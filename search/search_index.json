DTrace is a comprehensive dynamic tracing facility that is built into Solaris. The DTrace facility can be used to examine the behavior of user programs. The DTrace facility can also be used to examine the behavior of the operating system. DTrace can be used by system administrators or application developers, and is suitable for use with live production systems. DTrace will allow you to explore your system to understand how it works, track down performance problems across many layers of software, or locate the cause of aberrant behavior. As you'll see, DTrace lets you create your own custom programs to dynamically instrument the system and provide immediate, concise answers to arbitrary questions you can formulate using the DTrace D programming language. DTrace allows all Solaris users to: Dynamically enable and manage thousands of probes Dynamically associate logical predicates and actions with probes Dynamically manage trace buffers and buffer policies Display and examine trace data from the live system or a crash dump DTrace allows Solaris developers and administrators to: Implement custom scripts that use the DTrace facility Implement layered tools that use DTrace to retrieve trace data Requirements Basic familiarity with a programming language such as C or a scripting language such as awk(1) or perl(1) will help you learn DTrace and the D programming language faster, but you need not be an expert in any of these areas.

The Solaris Modular Debugger Guide describes how to use MDB to debug complex software systems, with a particular emphasis on the facilities available for debugging the Solaris kernel and associated device drivers and modules. It also includes a complete reference for and discussion of the MDB language syntax, debugger features, and MDB Module Programming API. Relevancy to OpenIndiana Hipster To be determined Target Audience If you were a detective and were investigating at the scene of a crime, you might interview the witnesses and ask them to describe what happened and who they saw. However, if there were no witnesses or these descriptions proved insufficient, you might consider collecting fingerprints and forensic evidence that could be examined for DNA to help solve the case. Often, software program failures divide into analogous categories: problems that can be solved with source-level debugging tools, and problems that require low-level debugging facilities, examination of core files, and knowledge of assembly language to diagnose and correct. MDB facilitates analysis of this second class of problems. MDB is most useful when you are programming a complex low-level software system such as an operating system. The MDB debugging framework allows you to construct your own custom analysis tools to aid in the diagnosis of these low-level problems. MDB also provides a powerful set of built-in commands that enable you to analyze the state of your program at the assembly language level.

AMD Radeon HD 3400 only works for 2D acceleration, due to missing KMS. Incomplete ACPI support: no suspend, low battery life (2hrs). Bryan Iotti Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 20A7004HRT yes Tested with July 2014 OpenIndiana Hipster ISO. Installed OI from USB drive (switched it to USB 2.0 mode in BIOS). Also selected legacy boot. Gigabit Ethernet (Intel l218-V) works with e1000g0 driver. Sound card (ddu detects Intel Haswell-ULT and Intel Lynx Point-LP HD Audio controllers) is detected, but doesn't work. Video adapter (Intel Haswell-ULT Integrated audio controller, Intel HD 4400) is recognized as VESA, but supports 1600x900 resolution. FN and functional \"keys\" work in general. Wireless adapter (Intel Wireles-N 7260) doesn't work Trackpad seems to be too sensitive and behaves strange. Updated at July 2019 Video adapter is working with Intel KMS driver. USB 3.0 ports work fine. Alexander Pyhalov Lenovo ThinkPad Edge E335 yes The laptop has no CD drive but can boot off a USB device; to install OI I used a USB HDD with grub4dos in first partition booting an oi_151a5 ISO image and a second 1GB partition with the USB image. Note that the right (yellow USB 2.0) port MUST be used during such setup. Gigabit Ethernet (Realtek) works, especially (more stable) with an updated gani driver from Free NIC drivers for OpenSolaris project. WiFi (Broadcom BCM4313) works with updated NDIS drivers (see source tarball in https://www.illumos.org/issues/3367 ) based on bcmwl5 64-bit variant of specific Windows driver versions, this supports WEP only. SATA support is strange (sometimes works, sometimes doesn't), so Compatibility mode (IDE) set via BIOS is preferential. USB3 (XHCI) does not work, those two left ports don't even power up a mouse. The USB2 port (right side) works, also with a USB hub. Battery status and model shown OK. Card reader not visible (probably hooked to USB3 chip). Sound system includes several devices (Realtek audio powering the speakers/mini-jack, and AMD Radeon HDMI audio), both driven as audiohd; in my case Realtek was detected as dsp1/mixer1/audio1/etc. and I had to replace the links (/dev/dsp /dev/audio /dev/mixer etc.) to force it to be used for sound by default. ALSA audio driver mode works, but with hicccups; OSS and SunAudio play music okay, but quite a bit too quiet in my testing (like 10% of the volume on the same system under another OS). Video adapter (AMD Vision E2 APU including the CPU and Radeon GPU) is not recognized as a \"radeon\" by \"modload /kernel/drv(/amd64)/radeon\" nor by X11, but works in correct resolution (1366*768) as \"vgatext\". Heavy video performs poorly (movies, videocamera tests), but during normal work/reading/browsing/development lags are nearly unnoticeable. NOTE: The keyboard does not include such keys as Pause/Break and SysRQ/ScrlLock. Some can be emulated (Fn+P, Fn+B, etc.), but I did not manage to find all of them. There is also only a power LED indicator, so you don't see HDD working, CAPS lock, etc. NumLock and at least an emulated numeric keypad are missing altogether. According to repairs docs, some variants of this laptop model can include an additional MiniPCI socket for WAN (3G modem) or mSATA SSD; my laptop does not have this feature soldered on (or I failed to find it). Jim Klimov Lenovo Thinkpad L470 yes Lenovo ThinkCenter m91p yes Aur\u00e9lien Larcher Lenovo Thinkpad P70 yes Lenovo ThinkPad T60 yes Milan Jurik Lenovo Thinkpad T430 yes Lenovo ThinkPad T520 yes The Intel Wifi Link 1000 and 6300 do NOT work. The NIC is an Intel 82579LM works well. The NVidia GPU works well with the nvidia driver. eSATA port works fine, but you'll have to use cfgadm to \"reconfigure\" the device so it picks up the plugged in disk. Josef \"Jeff\" Sipek Lenovo ThinkPad T520 (4240-5NG) yes No support for Realtek RTL8188CE 802.11b/g/n WiFi Adapter. No support for Integrated Intel VGA (generic VGA driver is used - 1024x768 only). Marcel Telka Lenovo ThinkPad T578 yes The Intel Corporation Centrino Wireless-N 1000 does NOT work. As noted for T520 it is not supported by Illumos. Logan Bruns Lenovo ThinkPad W520 yes Nvidia Quadro 1000m and Intel Centrino Ultimate-N 6300 (3x3 AGN). Cameron Jones Lenovo ThinkPad X220 yes Graphics Intel HD 3000 (Sandy Bridge) suffers from bug 8049 on the laptop's primary display if intel Xorg driver is used (vesa is fine but the display then has non-native 1024x768 resolution), but VGA (D-Sub) to external display works correctly. Intel 82579LM Ethernet controller works with e1000g driver. Wifi Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205 is attached to iwn driver but I did not test it so far (I don't see any wi-fi networks). Audio Intel HDA from C200 chipset works with audiohd driver. Touchpad, trackpoint, keyboard and USB mouse work. Volume & other buttons don't work. Michal Nowak Multirama-HT Xpress Book yes Apostolos Syropoulos Panasonic Toughbook Cf-18 yes Works, with VESA graphics driver. No Wacom driver for Xorg. Audio works through headphone output, no internal speaker. Disable system bell to avoid freezes. No 56k modem. ACPI works for battery status, no brightness adjustment. Networking and Wifi work. Bryan Lotti Sony VAIO VGN-S3XP yes cardbus does not work. nvidia driver does not fully support NV6200 Go chipset. System76 Bonobo Extreme yes Nripendra Khan System76 Galago UltraPro yes Driver: VESA Ankita Davis Toshiba Satellite L855 (PSKACE) no AMD Radeon HD 7670M Graphics requires KMS driver, which we don't have, so VESA only. Unfortunatelly display's native resolution is 1366x768 but the this resolution is not one of VESA modes, so 1024x768 or 800x600 has to be used, which renders the screen blurry. Nor HDMI nor VGA (D-Sub) works. Integrated Ethernet controller Atheros AR8161 is not supported, nor is Atheros AR9485 mini-PCI WLAN. What works: ACPI, battery statistics, chipset in general (Intel C216), sound (Intel HDA), SATA disks in AHCI mode, VT-x (tested in illumos KVM), touchpad, USB (both EHCI & xHCI) for input devices and storage. Michal Nowak Lenovo T530 yes NVidia NVS 5400M, Interl Centrino Advanced-N 6205 (taylor peak)(iwn), Intel 82579LM (ethernet/gigabit/e1000g) Everything works, even integrated camera Espen Martinsen Workstations OpenIndiana was tested by our users on the following workstations with UEFI.

Also it is recommended that you install HP's free hpacucli command to make it easier to enable swapped out hotswap drives. Logan Bruns HP DL380 G7 no Intel 5520 chipset based motherboard Broadcom Corporation NetXtreme II BCM5709 p410i RAID controller performance sucks like a hoover vaccum. No JBOD support. Requires new firmware all around or the installation of an SSD triggers a bug that starts a thermal shutdown iLO works as expected. Download drivers directly from HP along with the scripting toolkit to make bios configuration changes in OS \u2013 neat level of integration Expect monthly firmware updates on this platform. HP has a fix it in the field approach. There has been some conflict between LSI cards and HPs passive midplane. Every other column of disks must be left vacant or data corruption occurs. Last December LSI and HP were pointing fingers at each other, however, this problem may be resolved. I am no longer in a position where i can risk the data on the disks to find out. I installed both midplanes and half the drive slots are empty at the moment. Jason Matthews HP ML110 G7 yes Intel Xeon E3 1220, no reported driver issues.

Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E31220 @ 3.10GHz Socket 1 Ethernet 1 Intel 82574L Ethernet Controller Jorge Palma Escobar Intel MFSYS25 (6x blade server chassis with shared storage presented as SAN) yes No particular Solaris-related problems (all networking and storage components recognized by OI and several older Solaris 10 distros). Did not test MPxIO with Solaris because this box had no secondary IO controller (had it working with Linux and Windows on other such boxes). However the stability of remote serial console, remote graphical jKVM and remote media used for installation leaves a lot better to be desired (in comparison with Sun Fire IPMI/ILOM interfaces). May be a pain to install over pure remote-console networking, but this regards any OS we tried with the server. Physical distro media is very much recommended. After that, all works well =) Jim Klimov Intel SR2625URLX yes No problems Intel S5520 motherboard Intel Corporation 82801JI (ICH10 Family) Intel Corporation 82575EB Gigabit Network Connection RMM3 works as expected (as an OEMd service processor from AMI), but no bmc driver support in OI (works in Solaris 11) Onboard SATA/SAS ports work in AHCI mode on the passive midplane but hot plug seems broken. I recommend internal LSI cards in any case.

Gary Mills Hewlett-Packard 2710p yes ACPI works, no Wacom driver. Everything works fine, secondary port for graphics card listed as unknown, but external display works. Bryan Iotti Hewlett-Packard DV 6000 yes Works perfectly, including graphics, sound and usb Johan S Hewlett-Packard EilteBook 8760w yes WiFi fails from time to time, set \"set apix_enable=0\" in /etc/system to work-around illumos issue #1723 , SDcard works, NVIDIA Graphics work (3D accelerated), webcam works, USB3 works not of course (no driver), suspend does not work correctly Olaf Bohlen Hewlett-Packard EliteBook 6930p yes Works: WiFi, Ethernet, no driver issues after disabling Intel MEI/AMT. AMD Radeon HD 3400 only works for 2D acceleration, due to missing KMS. Incomplete ACPI support: no suspend, low battery life (2hrs). Bryan Iotti Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 20A7004HRT yes Tested with July 2014 OpenIndiana Hipster ISO. Installed OI from USB drive (switched it to USB 2.0 mode in BIOS). Also selected legacy boot. Gigabit Ethernet (Intel l218-V) works with e1000g0 driver. Sound card (ddu detects Intel Haswell-ULT and Intel Lynx Point-LP HD Audio controllers) is detected, but doesn't work. Video adapter (Intel Haswell-ULT Integrated audio controller, Intel HD 4400) is recognized as VESA, but supports 1600x900 resolution. FN and functional \"keys\" work in general. Wireless adapter (Intel Wireles-N 7260) doesn't work Trackpad seems to be too sensitive and behaves strange. Updated at July 2019 Video adapter is working with Intel KMS driver. USB 3.0 ports work fine. Alexander Pyhalov Lenovo ThinkPad Edge E335 yes The laptop has no CD drive but can boot off a USB device; to install OI I used a USB HDD with grub4dos in first partition booting an oi_151a5 ISO image and a second 1GB partition with the USB image. Note that the right (yellow USB 2.0) port MUST be used during such setup. Gigabit Ethernet (Realtek) works, especially (more stable) with an updated gani driver from Free NIC drivers for OpenSolaris project. WiFi (Broadcom BCM4313) works with updated NDIS drivers (see source tarball in https://www.illumos.org/issues/3367 ) based on bcmwl5 64-bit variant of specific Windows driver versions, this supports WEP only. SATA support is strange (sometimes works, sometimes doesn't), so Compatibility mode (IDE) set via BIOS is preferential. USB3 (XHCI) does not work, those two left ports don't even power up a mouse. The USB2 port (right side) works, also with a USB hub. Battery status and model shown OK. Card reader not visible (probably hooked to USB3 chip). Sound system includes several devices (Realtek audio powering the speakers/mini-jack, and AMD Radeon HDMI audio), both driven as audiohd; in my case Realtek was detected as dsp1/mixer1/audio1/etc. and I had to replace the links (/dev/dsp /dev/audio /dev/mixer etc.) to force it to be used for sound by default. ALSA audio driver mode works, but with hicccups; OSS and SunAudio play music okay, but quite a bit too quiet in my testing (like 10% of the volume on the same system under another OS). Video adapter (AMD Vision E2 APU including the CPU and Radeon GPU) is not recognized as a \"radeon\" by \"modload /kernel/drv(/amd64)/radeon\" nor by X11, but works in correct resolution (1366*768) as \"vgatext\". Heavy video performs poorly (movies, videocamera tests), but during normal work/reading/browsing/development lags are nearly unnoticeable. NOTE: The keyboard does not include such keys as Pause/Break and SysRQ/ScrlLock. Some can be emulated (Fn+P, Fn+B, etc.), but I did not manage to find all of them. There is also only a power LED indicator, so you don't see HDD working, CAPS lock, etc. NumLock and at least an emulated numeric keypad are missing altogether. According to repairs docs, some variants of this laptop model can include an additional MiniPCI socket for WAN (3G modem) or mSATA SSD; my laptop does not have this feature soldered on (or I failed to find it). Jim Klimov Lenovo Thinkpad L470 yes Lenovo ThinkCenter m91p yes Aur\u00e9lien Larcher Lenovo Thinkpad P70 yes Lenovo ThinkPad T60 yes Milan Jurik Lenovo Thinkpad T430 yes Lenovo ThinkPad T520 yes The Intel Wifi Link 1000 and 6300 do NOT work. The NIC is an Intel 82579LM works well. The NVidia GPU works well with the nvidia driver. eSATA port works fine, but you'll have to use cfgadm to \"reconfigure\" the device so it picks up the plugged in disk. Josef \"Jeff\" Sipek Lenovo ThinkPad T520 (4240-5NG) yes No support for Realtek RTL8188CE 802.11b/g/n WiFi Adapter. No support for Integrated Intel VGA (generic VGA driver is used - 1024x768 only). Marcel Telka Lenovo ThinkPad T578 yes The Intel Corporation Centrino Wireless-N 1000 does NOT work. As noted for T520 it is not supported by Illumos. Logan Bruns Lenovo ThinkPad W520 yes Nvidia Quadro 1000m and Intel Centrino Ultimate-N 6300 (3x3 AGN). Cameron Jones Lenovo ThinkPad X220 yes Graphics Intel HD 3000 (Sandy Bridge) suffers from bug 8049 on the laptop's primary display if intel Xorg driver is used (vesa is fine but the display then has non-native 1024x768 resolution), but VGA (D-Sub) to external display works correctly. Intel 82579LM Ethernet controller works with e1000g driver. Wifi Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205 is attached to iwn driver but I did not test it so far (I don't see any wi-fi networks). Audio Intel HDA from C200 chipset works with audiohd driver. Touchpad, trackpoint, keyboard and USB mouse work. Volume & other buttons don't work. Michal Nowak Multirama-HT Xpress Book yes Apostolos Syropoulos Panasonic Toughbook Cf-18 yes Works, with VESA graphics driver. No Wacom driver for Xorg. Audio works through headphone output, no internal speaker. Disable system bell to avoid freezes. No 56k modem. ACPI works for battery status, no brightness adjustment. Networking and Wifi work. Bryan Lotti Sony VAIO VGN-S3XP yes cardbus does not work. nvidia driver does not fully support NV6200 Go chipset. System76 Bonobo Extreme yes Nripendra Khan System76 Galago UltraPro yes Driver: VESA Ankita Davis Toshiba Satellite L855 (PSKACE) no AMD Radeon HD 7670M Graphics requires KMS driver, which we don't have, so VESA only. Unfortunatelly display's native resolution is 1366x768 but the this resolution is not one of VESA modes, so 1024x768 or 800x600 has to be used, which renders the screen blurry. Nor HDMI nor VGA (D-Sub) works. Integrated Ethernet controller Atheros AR8161 is not supported, nor is Atheros AR9485 mini-PCI WLAN. What works: ACPI, battery statistics, chipset in general (Intel C216), sound (Intel HDA), SATA disks in AHCI mode, VT-x (tested in illumos KVM), touchpad, USB (both EHCI & xHCI) for input devices and storage. Michal Nowak Lenovo T530 yes NVidia NVS 5400M, Interl Centrino Advanced-N 6205 (taylor peak)(iwn), Intel 82579LM (ethernet/gigabit/e1000g) Everything works, even integrated camera Espen Martinsen","title":"Laptops"},{"location":"community-hcl/systems/#workstations","text":"OpenIndiana was tested by our users on the following workstations with UEFI.

Download drivers directly from HP along with the scripting toolkit to make bios configuration changes in OS \u2013 neat level of integration Expect monthly firmware updates on this platform. HP has a fix it in the field approach. There has been some conflict between LSI cards and HPs passive midplane. Every other column of disks must be left vacant or data corruption occurs. Last December LSI and HP were pointing fingers at each other, however, this problem may be resolved. I am no longer in a position where i can risk the data on the disks to find out. I installed both midplanes and half the drive slots are empty at the moment. Jason Matthews HP ML110 G7 yes Intel Xeon E3 1220, no reported driver issues.

Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E31220 @ 3.10GHz Socket 1 Ethernet 1 Intel 82574L Ethernet Controller Jorge Palma Escobar Intel MFSYS25 (6x blade server chassis with shared storage presented as SAN) yes No particular Solaris-related problems (all networking and storage components recognized by OI and several older Solaris 10 distros). Did not test MPxIO with Solaris because this box had no secondary IO controller (had it working with Linux and Windows on other such boxes). However the stability of remote serial console, remote graphical jKVM and remote media used for installation leaves a lot better to be desired (in comparison with Sun Fire IPMI/ILOM interfaces). May be a pain to install over pure remote-console networking, but this regards any OS we tried with the server. Physical distro media is very much recommended.

If you do not already have a GitHub account, sign up for a Github account. Install and configure Git Operating System Command Arch pacman -S git Centos/RHEL yum install git Debian/Mint/Ubuntu apt-get install git Fedora dnf install git OpenIndiana pkg install git NOTE: After GIT is installed, be sure to configure your name and email address. For further details about configuring GIT, see: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/ Also, if you need a good book for quickly getting up to speed with GIT, see here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 Fear not though, only basic git commands are required for working with OI-DOCS. Install python-pip If your OS doesn't provide pre-packaged mkdocs, you'll need to install python-pip. This is not necessary on OpenIndiana. Operating System Command Arch pacman -S python-pip Centos/RHEL yum install python-pip Debian/Mint/Ubuntu apt-get install python-pip Fedora N/A - (Included with Fedora 25) OpenIndiana Not needed - (Use MkDocs IPS package) Install rubygems If your OS doesn't provide pre-packaged mdl, you'll need to install Ruby Gems. This is not necessary on OpenIndiana. Operating System Command Arch pacman -S ruby Centos/RHEL yum install rubygems Debian/Mint/Ubuntu apt-get install rubgems-integration Fedora dnf install rubygems OpenIndiana Not needed - (Use mdl IPS package) Install mkdocs For OpenIndiana Hipster, MKDocs and all of it's dependencies have been packaged and are available in the OI Hipster repository. So, if you're already running Hipster, installing MKDocs is as simple as: pkg install mkdocs Most other operating systems: pip install mkdocs mkdocs-bootswatch After MKDocs has been installed, be sure to verify your installation with mkdocs --version NOTE: If you experience difficulties installing mkdocs, try using the python 3 version of pip . For example: For Linux Mint 18, the python 3 version of pip would be pip3 . Install Markdown Lint (mdl) On OpenIndiana you can install mdl using standard package management tools: pkg install developer/documentation-tool/mdl For most operating systems: gem install mdl -v 0.4.0 Install Markdown plugin for VIM or Emacs (optional) https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown/ https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MarkdownMode Install Pandoc & XeTex (optional) For converting the docs to PDF, OI-Docs requires a Pandoc version of 2.8 (released 2019) or above and XeTex/XeLaTex. The latest versions of Pandoc are available (in .deb & .tar.gz) from Pandoc GitHub releases . Pandoc is not yet avalible packaged on OpenIndiana. Operating System Command Arch pacman -S pandoc Centos/RHEL yum install pandoc texlive-xetex Debian/Mint/Ubuntu apt-get install pandoc texlive-xetex Fedora dnf install pandoc texlive-xetex OpenIndiana Not packaged yet NOTE: Not all OS distro repositories contain XeTex. In this case it could be installed as part of a manual TeX Live installation. As of Summer 2021, the version of Pandoc available from OS distro repositories may be too old (was the case for Centos/RHEL and Debian < 11). In this case you can try and use the Pandoc GitHub release versions instead. Fork the OpenIndiana Docs repository Open your web browser to the OpenIndiana Docs GitHub Repository . Click the Fork button found in the upper right hand corner of the page. Forking creates a server side clone of the upstream repository. This clone is your own personal copy of the OpenIndiana Docs repository. Create a local clone of your fork git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USER-NAME/oi-docs.git The local clone is where you will perform your work. Think of your local clone as your working copy of the repository. The local clone is also where you will commit your changes. Periodically you will push these local changes to your fork residing on Github. Add the upstream repository cd oi-docs git remote add upstream https://github.com/OpenIndiana/oi-docs.git Verify things with git remote -v You should now see: origin https://github.com/YOUR-USER-NAME/oi-docs.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/YOUR-USER-NAME/oi-docs.git (push) upstream https://github.com/OpenIndiana/oi-docs.git (fetch) upstream https://github.com/OpenIndiana/oi-docs.git (push) Sync and merge changes from the upstream repository Periodically you will want to rebase your local copy by bringing in changes from the upstream repository. In plain English, this means the upstream repository is locally registered so you can periodically pull down changes from the upstream master repository and merge them into your local clone. This way your local clone remains in synchronization with the master upstream repository. It is always a good idea to perform a pull from the upstream master repository prior to making changes to your local clone (working copy). git pull upstream master OpenIndiana Docs site structure (master branch) All site development occurs within the master branch. oi-docs/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 docs/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 link_validator.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 makepdf.sh \u251c\u2500\u2500 markdownlint-rules.rb \u251c\u2500\u2500 mkdocs.yml \u251c\u2500\u2500 pandoc/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 pdf/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md \u2514\u2500\u2500 site/ Resource Description oi-docs/ site root folder docs/ documentation root folder link_validator.py URL validation script makepdf.sh PDF Generation script markdownlint-rules.rb Markdown Lint configuration mkdocs.yml Site and menu configuration pandoc/ Pandoc configuration files folder (for makepdf.sh) pdf/ Generated PDFs folder README.md Git readme site/ Live preview folder (no edits) CAUTION: Please do NOT perform any work within the site/ or pdf/ folder. site/ is a temporary folder created by MkDocs when the site is run locally in preview mode. pdf/ is a temporary folder for storing locally generated PDFs.

To do so, issue the following command: mkdocs serve --dev-addr=0.0.0.0:8000 Running Markdown Lint (locally) Markdown Lint is used to check your changes for Markdown syntax errors. Prior to submitting a pull request (PR), please consider running Markdown Lint locally on your computer. From the root of the oi-docs/ directory, execute the following command: mdl -s markdownlint-rules.rb . Markdown Lint will automatically traverse the entire folder structure looking for problems. Alternately you may also run mdl on a specific file. Simply replace the period (.) with the path to the file. NOTE: Before you can run mdl , it may be necessary to modify your $PATH variable: see \u201c Install Markdown Lint \u201d above. Generating PDFs (locally) Pandoc (via XeLaTex) is used to create PDF versions of pages. The makepdf.sh bash script automatically moves through a subset of the docs directories creating a PDF for every Markdown file. Prior to submitting a pull request (PR), please consider running the Pandoc PDF generation script locally on your computer to ensure no Pandoc incompatibilities have been introduced. To convert multiple pages to PDF, execute the following command from the root of the oi-docs/ directory: ./makepdf.sh This will produce PDF versions (placed in oi-docs/pdf/ ) of most of the doc pages. Not all pages are suitible for conversion yet, some contain incompatible HTML which needs to be fixed before they can be converted. To convert a single file, the -f option can be used. Likewise, the -d option can be used for converting files all files in a given directory. By default the PDFs are styled/formatted to look similar to the HTML docs produced by MkDocs. This can be changed using the -s option. Currently the only other option is 'opensolaris' which produces PDFs in the style of OpenSolaris Solbook documentation. The formatting and restyling required for the PDFs is configured with files in the pandoc/ folder of the root directory. Each style uses a pair of files, a .yaml file to specifiy Pandoc settings & LaTex/XeLaTex headers and a .lua Lua script to apply formatting to the Pandoc native representation (AST). For more information on Pandoc, see the official Pandoc Manual . CAUTION: Inline HTML is not supported by Pandoc for PDF output and is not rendered at all in PDFs produced. Ensure that you only use Markdown in your edits. The only exception is for the mkdocs div elements used to create these 'Note' breakouts - support for these has been manually programmed into the Pandoc lua filters. Enabling spell checking in vim You can invoke spell checking in your current session by inputting the command: :set spell spelllang=en_us If you would like a more permanent solution, enable spell checking in your .vimrc by adding the line: set spelllang=en_us Misspelled words will now be highlighted (color varies dependent on your .Xresources file) Keyboard shortcuts for spell checking in vim ]s to find the previously misspelled word. [s to find the next misspelled word. With the cursor at the beginning of a word, use z= to bring up a list of suggested replacements. zg will add a word to the local dictionary exception file. zw is used to mark a word as incorrect. Commit and push your changes. git status git add some-file-you-just-edited git commit -m 'your commit message' git push When you make a commit, you are committing those changes locally to your clone. When you perform a push, your are pushing your commits from your local clone to your fork residing on Github. Send a pull request. Open your web browser to your forked copy of the OpenIndiana Docs repository. For example: https://github.com/your-user-name/oi-docs Click the button for New pull request . Add some notes about your change. Submit your PR (pull request). Pull requests are used to request a pull in of changes from your fork to the master repository. NOTE: After a pull request has been submitted, and for the duration of time your pull request remains open and uncommitted to the OI-DOCS master repository, any additional commits you make to your own fork of the oi-docs repository will automatically be included in your open pull request. What happens next? At this point a member of the OpenIndiana Project docs team will review your changes. If no corrections are required, your changes will be accepted and merged into the upstream repository.

Allows you to determine who made a particular change. Allows you to roll back changes as needed.

Introduction to Git Git is a distributed version control system written by Linus ( the terrible ) Torvalds, the BDFL of the Linux operating system. Fortunately, Git isn't terrible at all.

Read on to learn more.... Git Vocabulary - Repositories Before diving into the mechanics of what Git does, or even how to use it, let's review some basic Git vocabulary as it pertains to working with Git repositories. Term Definition Upstream Repository The Upstream repository is the repository under the direct control of the project. It contains the Golden Copy of all the files and folders held in Git version control. Nobody can make changes to this repository, unless the project allows it. Fork Before contributing to a project using Git, you first need to make a server side copy of the upstream repository. When you do this, you are Forking the upstream repository. This copy of the repository is under your control. When you submit changes, they are stored in this copy of the upstream repository. Clone Before editing any files, you first need to Clone your forked copy of the upstream repository. Cloning creates a local working copy of the files and folders which resides on your computer. When you make changes, you are making changes to your cloned copy of the files and folders. You may locally clone the repository on as many computers as you wish. Git Vocabulary - Commands Now let's review some of the most commonly used Git commands and how you might use them. Command Description git clone In the previous section, we already mentioned a little about clones and what they are. Therefore, you would use the git clone command to create your editable local working copy of the files and folders. git status The git status command shows you whether any local files have been changed. git diff The git diff command shows you precisely what changed, for each local file which changed. git add The git add command lets you stage local files so their changes may be recorded locally by Git. git commit The git commit command allows you to locally record changes to staged local files and even include a nice little message describing your changes. git pull The git pull command allows you to pull in (merge) changes originating from a remote repository (either your fork or the upstream repository). git push The git push command lets you push locally recorded changes (your commits) up to your forked copy of the upstream repository. Git Pull Requests Now that we've explained several of the most basic Git commands, you might be left thinking: Great, so how do changes which now reside in my forked copy of the repository, find their way to the upstream repository? That's an excellent question; I am so happy you asked. The answer is of course, by submitting a pull request . When you submit a pull request you are requesting the differences found in your forked copy of the upstream repository to be pulled into the upstream repository itself. At this point other members of project will perform a quality assurance review of your changes. If your changes are accepted by the project, they will be pulled (merged) into the upstream repository. Git Usage Scenario Git does not limit you to working on a single computer. In fact, you can work with the very same set of files using multiple computers. Two different git commands make this possible. git push git pull Sound pretty simple huh? Well that's because it is. Here is a practical examples of how you might use Git: Scenario 1 You're at home in the morning drinking your coffee, wearing your favorite bunny slippers, and busily working on the computer. Morning is your most creative time so you've made lots of changes to your files. When finished, you do the following: View a list of changed files using git status . View the file differences using git diff . Locally stage changed files for commit using git add <file name> or using git add . to stage all changed files.. Locally record your changes using git commit -m <message> . Safeguard your local commits by pushing them up to your forked copy of the upstream repository using the git push command. Scenario 2 Now it's time to go to work and while on lunch break you want to make some more edits to your files. That's simple enough, perform the following steps. If the local clone already exists: Execute the git pull command to pull in (merge) the changes you made earlier in the morning. If the clone does not already exist: Pull down a local working copy of your forked upstream repository using the command: git clone <URL of fork> Now let's throw a little twist to this scenario. You have just received an email from another member of the project development team. In the email contains a note advising you of a completed (accepted and merged) pull request relating to the upstream repository. No problem, you'll simply do the following: Pull in (merge) those upstream changes into your local working copy using the command git pull upstream master . Now your local working copy contains all the changes from both your fork as well the upstream repository. When you're finished making changes, you'll safeguard those changes with another cycle of stage , commit , and push . And whenever you're ready, submit a pull request to have the differences found in your fork pulled into the upstream repository. Now that wasn't so bad was it? Installing Git Installing Git on OpenIndiana Hipster is simple. pkg install git After Git is installed, be sure to configure your name and email address.

Integrity - You can roll back to previous versions Mobility - You can edit docs anywhere, no Internet connection required Consistency - Docs are treated just like code Why a text markup based docs framework? The primary advantage of using a text markup language is: Readability Flexibility The raw code for your authored content is simple plain text. No need for special tools such as WYSIWYG XML editors, etc. What is MkDocs? MkDocs is a modern, flexible, and feature rich content authoring framework and static website generator. The python based MkDocs framework publishes content as HTML5. In conjunction with the MkDocs-Pandoc module, content may also be published in the PDF and EPUB formats. Unlike a CMS system where you are restricted to the confines of an integral editor, the OpenIndiana Docs website has no such restriction. Here content is authored using a simple text based markup. Because you are working with plain text files, content may be authored using Atom, EMACS, Gedit, Nano, VIM, or any other text editor. The choice is yours; Use your favorite editor.

Given FAQ's are so rarely composed of things people actually inquire about, having a document titled 'About OpenIndiana' made more sense for this documentation site. Suggested topics: Below are some resources which may be useful for further improving this document. Take some time to look them over for ideas and inspiration for writing new content: OpenSolaris FAQ OpenSolaris Newbie FAQ Handbook - Getting Started DOC TEAM NOTE: Page URL: https://openindiana.github.io/oi-docs/handbook/getting-started/ Page location within docs site: /oi-docs/docs/handbook/getting-started.md DOC TEAM NOTE: This document is likely to change significantly over the course of it's development. Some topics may be moved to more relevant locations within other documents. As the document grows and matures, it is likely to become necessary to break things up into smaller more manageable pieces. The Getting Started document has been initially structured to cover the following topics: Introduction OpenIndiana software releases System requirements Exploring OpenIndiana Preparation for installing OpenIndiana Creating a bootable OpenIndiana DVD Creating a bootable OpenIndiana USB flash drive Booting OpenIndiana installer media Installing OpenIndiana Post installation steps Troubleshooting installations The Image Package System (IPS) Managing boot environments The X-Window system Suggested topics: Import first section of Wiki page: http://wiki.openindiana.org/oi/Using+OpenIndiana+-+Technical+FAQ Have a look at the following resources for ideas and inspiration for writing new content: OpenSolaris Automated Installer Guide Linux Versus OpenSolaris IPS versus apt - from IPS guide System partitioning, Gparted, etc. Device Driver utility - (also how to manually install missing drivers - and where to find them if they are available) How to disable drivers at boot time Network install drivers: pkgrecv -s http://pkg.openindiana.org/hipster-2015 -d bash.p5a -a bash && sudo pkg install -nv -g bash.p5a bash Local install drivers: pkg install -g name.p5a fmri Handbook - Common Tasks DOC TEAM NOTE: Page URL: https://openindiana.github.io/oi-docs/handbook/common-tasks/ Page location within docs site: /oi-docs/docs/handbook/common-tasks.md DOC TEAM NOTE: This document is likely to change significantly over the course of it's development. Some topics may be moved to more relevant locations within other documents. As the document grows and matures, it is likely to become necessary to break things up into smaller more manageable pieces. The Common Tasks document has been initially structured to cover the following topics: Basic UNIX commands Basic system administration Desktop applications Multimedia - Audio Multimedia - Video Printing Graphics workstation Desktop Publishing system, Etc. Currently this section is largely desktop oriented. Perhaps some additional items such as system backups might fit better in this section. As previously mentioned, this is a living document and things will likely get shuffled around as the document matures. Suggested topics: CUPS Printing The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) has been selected as the default print service, replacing the LP print service, in OpenSolaris 2010.03. CUPS support includes a web and graphical interface to manage your printing environment. A system that is running CUPS becomes a host that can accept print requests from client systems, process those requests, and then send them to the appropriate printer. To facilitate CUPS support, a new print-service command has been introduced that provides a mechanism for switching between CUPS print service and the LP print service, including 2 new SMF services. Doc team Note: The guidance provided by the OSOL printing administration book is largely obsolete (but parts may still be valid) as CUPS replaced the old Solaris printing subsystem found in OpenSolaris 2009.06. However, OpenIndiana has 2 print subsystems (CUPS and LP). They are managed by the print-service command, which allows you to designate the active print subsystem. See the print-services (1M) man page for more information. In contrast, Oracle dropped lp completely in the Solaris 11.0 release.

The appendix document has been initially structured to cover the following topics: Finding help and support Developing with OpenIndiana Software Development Testing This document might also be a good place to put the following topics: Basic UNIX commands Contrast and comparison tables (e.g. Unix versus Linux, etc.) Feature comparison tables Suggested topics: Write a table where included features of OpenIndiana are compared to licensed features found in commercial software. For example: Qemu-KVM | HyperV, Esxi, etc. , Zones | Docker, etc. Need to look at the legal aspects of mentioning trademarked names within documentation (to help keep openindiana out of trouble).

You usually don't need to build legacy consolidations them manually. Building oi-build CAUTION: oi-build is a legacy consolidation which was superceded with oi-userland !!! For building oi-userland see Building with oi-userland Following instructions describe building oi-build on legacy OpenIndiana /dev distribution. oi-build is OpenIndiana's primary build framework for post-oi_151 development. It is set to replace all existing consolidations, vastly simplifying how we build the operating system. oi-build is also tied into our continuous integration platform. When an update is committed to the oi-build mercurial repository, an automated build is kicked off. This will then automatically publish the built package to the /experimental repo, or generate an email alert if the build failed (to be completed). oi-build overview oi-build is a fork of Oracle's userland-gate, which we have extended and added additional software to. The layout is very similar. Inside oi-build is a directory called components , under which lives a directory for each software package. Inside each of these software package directories is a main Makefile , as well as one or more .p5m IPS manifest files, and there may also be license files and patches. The Makefile essentially contains a \"build recipe\". To build a piece of software, you simply cd into the directory of the software, and type make TARGET , where TARGET can be one of: prep : Download, extract and patch the software archive build : Build the software install : Install the software into the prototype directory sample-manifest : Create a sample manifest file in the build directory publish : Publish the software to the local userland IPS repo For more details about writing Makefiles for userland, see userland Makefile targets and variables NOTE: Before adding new packages to illumos-userland... Before considering adding a new package to oi-build, please check first whether someone else is working on the package by checking the issue tracker. If you don't find anyone already working on a port, please register your effort by opening an issue. If you wish to update an existing port, look at the log for the component Makefile (\"hg log Makefile\") and make sure you either contact the person who last updated the Makefile or include them on notifications for the issue by ticking their name. This will ensure efforts aren't duplicated and help to ensure sanity and comity amongst project members. Setting up your build environment We strongly recommend building packages inside a fresh local zone set up exclusively for building. Some suggestions about build environment (dataset layouts, etc.) can also be found in the illumos wiki: How to build illumos (note however that compilers required for the core OS may be different than those acceptable for userland software). Ensuring your system is up to date oi-build requires that your system be updated with the latest software from the pkg.openindiana.org/experimental repository. The procedure to do this is as follows: sudo /usr/bin/pkg set-publisher -p http://pkg.openindiana.org/experimental/ sudo /usr/bin/pkg set-publisher -P oi-experimental sudo /usr/bin/pkg set-publisher --non-sticky openindiana.org sudo /usr/bin/pkg install -v package/pkg sudo /usr/bin/pkg update -v The first line adds the experimental repo to your package publisher list, the second line sets it as the primary publisher, and the third line allows packages from the experimental repo to replace those installed from the openindiana.org repo. The last line updates your system with the newer packages. Note: If you are doing this in a zone and encounter an error from pkg about being unable to clone the current boot environment, you will need to update the zone from the global zone by doing: ZONE=yourzonename ZONEROOT=`zonecfg -z $ZONE info zonepath | awk '{print $NF}'` sudo zoneadm -z $ZONE halt sudo zoneadm -z $ZONE ready export PYTHONPATH=${ZONEROOT}/root/usr/lib/python2.6/vendor-packages sudo ${ZONEROOT}/root/usr/bin/pkg -R ${ZONEROOT}/root set-publisher -p http://pkg.openindiana.org/experimental/ sudo ${ZONEROOT}/root/usr/bin/pkg -R ${ZONEROOT}/root set-publisher -P oi-experimental sudo ${ZONEROOT}/root/usr/bin/pkg -R ${ZONEROOT}/root set-publisher --non-sticky openindiana.org sudo ${ZONEROOT}/root/usr/bin/pkg -R ${ZONEROOT}/root install -v package/pkg sudo ${ZONEROOT}/root/usr/bin/pkg -R ${ZONEROOT}/root update -v unset PYTHONPATH ZONE ZONEROOT Note that the /experimental repo is under continuous development and may contain breakage. Thus we (as mentioned) strongly recommend building inside a dedicated development zone, rather than updating your main system. Installing pre-requisites First, lets install the required software list: sudo /usr/bin/pkg install pkg:/archiver/gnu-tar pkg:/compress/p7zip pkg:/compress/unzip \\ pkg:/developer/build/ant pkg:/developer/build/autoconf pkg:/developer/build/automake-110 \\ pkg:/developer/build/gnu-make pkg:/developer/build/libtool pkg:/developer/build/make \\ pkg:/developer/gcc-3 pkg:/developer/gnome/gettext pkg:/developer/java/jdk \\ pkg:/developer/java/junit pkg:/developer/lexer/flex pkg:/developer/macro/cpp \\ pkg:/developer/macro/gnu-m4 pkg:/developer/object-file pkg:/developer/parser/bison \\ pkg:/developer/versioning/mercurial pkg:/file/gnu-coreutils pkg:/file/gnu-findutils \\ pkg:/library/libtool/libltdl pkg:/library/libxslt pkg:/library/pcre \\ pkg:/runtime/perl-512 pkg:/system/library/math/header-math pkg:/text/gawk \\ pkg:/text/gnu-diffutils pkg:/text/gnu-gettext pkg:/text/gnu-grep \\ pkg:/text/gnu-patch pkg:/text/gnu-sed pkg:/text/groff \\ pkg:/text/texinfo pkg:/library/neon pkg:/library/apr-util-13 \\ pkg:/developer/library/lint pkg:/system/header pkg:/developer/build/onbld \\ pkg:/data/docbook Changes on Sun Studio compilers Oracle just moved the Studio Compiler. Now you need to login to access \"Oracle Solaris Studio 12.3\" they can be found at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/solarisstudio/downloads/index.html The following steps are needed to get it running: export DOWNLOAD_LOCATION=$HOME cd /opt tar xjf $DOWNLOAD_LOCATION/SolarisStudio12.3-solaris-x86-bin.tar.bz2 -C ./ ln -s /opt/SolarisStudio12.3-solaris-x86-bin/solarisstudio12.3/ ./SUNWspro Downloading oi-build and preparing for first use See the illumos wiki instructions How to build illumos for optional suggestions about build environment (dedicated ZFS dataset layouts, etc.) Check out the repository (subdirectory oi-build must not pre-exist): cd ~ hg clone https://hg.openindiana.org/oi-build cd oi-build Now we will run the setup stage, which will prepare some tools, and create an IPS pkg5 repository for first use under the i386/build directory: cd $HOME/oi-build # If you have the Sun Studio compilers installed gmake setup # If you don't have (access to) the Studio compilers or want to use GCC gmake setup COMPILER=gcc Important: Checking your environment Make the check-environment target to check your environment is set up correctly: gmake check-environment This will report back any issues. Adding the local repository to your publisher list sudo /usr/bin/pkg set-publisher -p file://$HOME/oi-build/i386/repo sudo /usr/bin/pkg set-publisher -P oi-build You will now be able to pkg install the software you have built and published via oi-build. Optional: Running a local pkg server for installation on other zones/hosts If you would like to use your oi-build repository on other zones or hosts, you can run a pkg server: /usr/lib/pkg.depotd -d $HOME/oi-build/i386/repo -p 10000 On other hosts, you can then specify http://hostname:10000 instead of the file:// address above. See the illumos wiki instructions How to build illumos for optional suggestions about running a pkg server instance as an SMF service. Ready to build and install your first package Simply descend into the oi-build/components/SOFTWARE directory (where SOFTWARE is the name of the bit of software you wish to build): cd $HOME/oi-build/components/SOFTWARE gmake publish sudo pkg install SOFTWARE Contributing changes back to oi-build Preparing you changes for review When you think your changes are ready for review you will need to generate a diff. The most common way to do this is \"hg diff\". It's recommended that you explain the implications of your changeset if it's not immediately obvious, and how you've tested it. Committing changes If you changeset has had either \"2 thumbs up and 3 days open for review\" or \"4 thumbs up\" then you are now ready to push you changes to the repo. Add and commit all files for your new component using: cd ~/oi-build/components/SOFTWARE hg add Makefile *.p5m <etc.> hg commit . Commit messages must follow this format: <bug id> <bug summary> Reviewed by: Reviewer Name <reviewer.name@fake.net> Reviewed by: Reviewer Name <reviewer.name@fake.net> Reviewed by: Reviewer Name <reviewer.name@fake.net> Approved by: My Name <my.name@mydomain.net> When committing changes on behalf of someone else the commit message remains the same but you must pass the committer's name to hg commit. hg commit -u 'Contributor Name contributor.name@fake.net ' Building IPS/pkg NOTE: For building IPS delivered with modern OpenIndiana, use openindiana/pkg oi-userland component. Following instructions describe building pkg on legacy OpenIndiana /dev distribution. Make sure you have Sun Studio installed. Install dependencies: sudo pkg install \\ developer/build/autoconf \\ developer/build/automake-110 \\ developer/opensolaris/pkg5 \\ developer/swig \\ developer/versioning/mercurial \\ gnome/accessibility/gnome-a11y-libs \\ library/python-2/python-gnome-extras-26 \\ library/python-2/python-notify-26 \\ package/pkg/package-manager \\ package/pkg/update-manager \\ developer/python/pylint \\ service/network/dns/mdns \\ system/library/math/header-math \\ text/gnu-patch \\ developer/gnome/gnome-doc-utils \\ system/zones/internal Set up your environment: GATE=pkg BUILDNUM=151 pfexec /sbin/zfs create -o atime=off -p rpool/export/builds/$GATE pfexec chown `id -u`:`id -g` /export/builds/$GATE cd /export/builds/$GATE unset CC unset CXX PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/opt/SUNWspro/bin:/usr/ccs/bin export PATH Get the source and update it to the right branch: hg clone https://hg.openindiana.org/sustaining/oi_151a/pkg-gate/ pkg-gate cd pkg-gate hg update oi_151a Start the building process: cd src dmake install make -e packages BUILDNUM=${BUILDNUM} export PATH=`pwd`/../proto/root_`uname -p`/usr/bin:$PATH export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/../proto/root_`uname -p`/usr/lib/python2.6/vendor-packages:$PYTHONPATH cd pkg make BUILDNUM=${BUILDNUM} make repository-metadata Optional unit tests, which take forever: cd .. make test-verbose Building SFW Following instructions describe building SFW on legacy OpenIndiana /dev distribution. SFW is the Solars Freeware consolidation, which includes a lot of FOSS software. Misc note: By default on re-invoking env -i /opt/onbld/bin/nightly yourenvscrip.sh the build process will clear up the previous build run by removing directories with rm -rf Building SFW is a lot like building ONNV. It's recommended you build SFW on a version of ONNV that's not too far behind it (e.g. build SFW 145 on ONNV 144). Please ensure Sun Studio is set up and pkg has been installed from pkg-gate, as per the ONNV build instructions. Also ensure an up to date onbld is present for the version of SFW you're building (if you've built ONNV on the same box then that will be the case). Installing dependencies You'll need to ensure the following dependencies are installed: sudo pkg install \\ archiver/gnu-tar \\ compatibility/ucb \\ compress/unzip \\ data/docbook \\ database/mysql-51/library \\ database/postgres-82/developer \\ developer/build/ant \\ developer/build/autoconf \\ developer/build/automake-19 \\ developer/build/automake-110 \\ developer/build/cmake \\ developer/build/gnu-make \\ developer/build/libtool \\ developer/build/onbld \\ developer/gcc-3 \\ developer/gnome/gettext \\ developer/java/junit \\ developer/lexer/flex \\ developer/object-file \\ developer/parser/bison \\ developer/versioning/subversion \\ file/gnu-coreutils \\ file/gnu-findutils \\ library/c++/sigcpp \\ library/gd \\ library/glib1 \\ library/graphics/wxwidgets \\ library/guile \\ library/libevent \\ library/libtorrent \\ library/motif \\ library/mozilla-nss/header-nss \\ library/nspr \\ library/nspr/header-nspr \\ library/pcre \\ library/perl-5/database \\ library/python-2/libxml2-26 \\ library/python-2/setuptools-26 \\ library/slang \\ library/tooltalk \\ print/cups \\ print/filter/ghostscript \\ runtime/erlang \\ runtime/lua \\ runtime/ocaml \\ runtime/ocaml/lablgtk \\ service/network/slp \\ system/header/header-audio \\ system/header/header-ugen \\ system/header/header-usb \\ system/header/header-agp \\ system/library/libpcap \\ system/library/math/header-math \\ system/library/usb/libusb \\ system/network/avahi \\ text/gawk \\ text/gnu-diffutils \\ text/gnu-gettext \\ text/gnu-grep \\ text/gnu-patch \\ text/gnu-sed \\ text/groff \\ text/texinfo \\ web/java-servlet/tomcat \\ web/server/apache-13 \\ web/server/apache-22 \\ x11/library/mesa \\ x11/optional-clients Then run the following to set up the build environment: pfexec sh /usr/share/sgml/docbook/docbook-catalog-install.sh Note: This command seems to be unnecessary. Note: If repeating builds do not repeat the docbook-catalog-install.sh, it will break stuff! You will likely find that the build never completes. Instead, it hangs with a spinning `yes' command. This happens because php-5.2.17 must be built with version 2.13 of the autoconf tools. Version 2.69 is installed by the package listed above. You will need to build 2.1.3 from source and install it where it won't interfere with 2.69. /opt/auto is a suitable place.

The Makefile essentially contains a \"build recipe\". To build a piece of software, you simply cd into the directory of the software, and type make TARGET , where TARGET can be one of: prep : Download, extract and patch the software archive build : Build the software install : Install the software into the prototype directory sample-manifest : Create a sample manifest file in the build directory publish : Publish the software to the local userland IPS repo For more details about writing Makefiles for userland, see userland Makefile targets and variables NOTE: Before adding new packages to illumos-userland... Before considering adding a new package to oi-build, please check first whether someone else is working on the package by checking the issue tracker. If you don't find anyone already working on a port, please register your effort by opening an issue. If you wish to update an existing port, look at the log for the component Makefile (\"hg log Makefile\") and make sure you either contact the person who last updated the Makefile or include them on notifications for the issue by ticking their name.

It's tied into OpenIndiana continuous integration platform . When an update is committed to the oi-userland git repository: an automated build is kicked off, then automatically the binary package will be published to the /hipster repository, finally, the status of the build will be reported by oibot to the #oi-dev libera.chat IRC channel. Overview of oi-userland Originally oi-userland is a fork of Oracle's userland-gate which evolved in an independent way. The layout is very similar. Inside oi-userland is a directory called \"components\", under which directories for software package category groups live. Inside each of these package group directories are typically directories for all software packages belonging to the category. Some have even more sub-directories before reaching the leaf directories containing the software packages. Note that some software packages don't have a package category group yet. Inside each of the software package directories there is a main Makefile and other files necessary to build one or more packages. The complete set of instructions to build one or more related packages is called \"a component\". A component usually consists of several files: Makefile : the recipe to build the software and install it locally (usually to the build/prototype/$(MACH) directory) patches/ : directory containing patches applied before the configuration files/ : directory containing additional files distributed with packages *.p5m : manifests used to generate the IPS package $(COMPONENT_NAME).license : file containing the licenses applicable to the software To build a component you simply cd into the directory of the software, and type \"gmake TARGET\" (here we use gmake to call GNU make), where TARGET can be one of: Target Description clobber cleans up the component directory completely, including deleting source download fetches the source archive and verify its SHA256 sum prep extract and apply patches build configure and build install install software into the prototype directory sample-manifest generate a sample IPS manifest based on the files installed to the prototype directory publish publish the package to the local repository pre-publish run all pre-publication checks (does actually what publish does, just without sending package to local repository) REQUIRED_PACKAGES guess and generate build dependencies for the packages, manual edit might be needed env-check check build environment for missing packages env-prep install missing build dependencies (requires elevated privileges) NOTE: Before adding new packages to oi-userland... Before considering adding a new package to oi-userland, please check first whether someone else is working on the package by checking the issue tracker, mailing oi-dev@openindiana.org or asking on the IRC (#oi-dev at irc.libera.chat) If you don't find anyone already working on a port, please register your effort by opening an issue. If you wish to update an existing port, look at the log for the component Makefile (\"git log Makefile\") and make sure you either contact the person who last updated the Makefile or include them on notifications for the issue by ticking their name. This will ensure efforts aren't duplicated and help to ensure sanity and comity amongst project members. Setting up your build environment We strongly recommend building packages inside a fresh local zone set up exclusively for building. See Quick zone setup example for simple instructions. Further we assume that you are logged into the build zone if you set up the build environment in a zone the directory were oi-userland is cloned can otherwise be anywhere you like. Adding RBAC profile to the build user Installing software requires privileges, so your build user must have at minimum the 'Software Installation' profile: $ profiles Software Installation ZFS File System Management Console User Suspend To RAM Suspend To Disk Brightness CPU Power Management Network Autoconf User Desktop Removable Media User Basic Solaris User All If it is not the case add this profile to your build user: pfexec su - usermod -P'Software Installation' <username> This is not necessary if your user has already the 'Primary Administrator' profile. Downloading oi-userland Start by forking oi-userland repository on Github and then check out the repository (subdirectory oi-userland must not pre-exist): cd ~ git clone https://github.com/mylogin/oi-userland cd oi-userland Add https://github.com/OpenIndiana/oi-userland/ as upstream to your repository to resync your repository with oi-userland. git remote add upstream https://github.com/OpenIndiana/oi-userland/ Run the setup stage which will prepare some tools and create an IPS pkg5 repository for first use under the i386 directory: cd $HOME/oi-userland gmake setup Adding the local repository to your publisher list pfexec pkg set-publisher -g file://$HOME/oi-userland/i386/repo userland pfexec pkg set-publisher --non-sticky openindiana.org Setting the local repository as primary publisher pfexec pkg set-publisher --search-first userland Optional: Running a local pkg server for installation on other zones/hosts If you would like to use your oi-userland repository on other zones or hosts, you can run a pkg server: $ pfexec svccfg -s pkg/server svc:/application/pkg/server> add oi-userland svc:/application/pkg/server> select oi-userland svc:/application/pkg/server:oi-userland> addpg pkg application svc:/application/pkg/server:oi-userland> setprop pkg/inst_root=astring:\"/export/home/username/oi-userland/i386/repo\" svc:/application/pkg/server:oi-userland> setprop pkg/port=count:\"10000\" svc:/application/pkg/server:oi-userland> setprop pkg/readonly=boolean:\"true\" svc:/application/pkg/server:oi-userland> refresh svc:/application/pkg/server:oi-userland> exit $ pfexec svcadm enable oi-userland On other hosts you can then specify http://hostname:10000 instead of the file:// address above. If you only intend to install and test packages locally this is not necessary as on-disk repository access suffices. Building and installing your first packages Enter to oi-userland/components/PATH/TO/COMPONENT directory and run: cd $HOME/oi-userland/components/SOFTWARE gmake env-prep gmake publish pfexec pkg refresh pfexec pkg install pkg://userland/PACKAGE_FMRI Here PACKAGE_FMRI is a full name (FMRI) of package which you want to install. The FMRIs of published packages will be printed in the end of publish stage. Note, that running gmake env-prep is strictly not required, if you are sure that all build requirements are satisfied. To speed up the compilation you can pass an optional argument to gmake setting COMPONENT_BUILD_ARGS variable in your environment, for instance with export COMPONENT_BUILD_ARGS=-j4 to use 4 jobs for builds. Creating your first component The easiest way to create new component is to take one which is similar to yours and modify it as needed. Also you can look at Makefile templates delivered with oi-userland. Creating Makefile A component Makefile usually contains variables describing how a component should be built, installed and packaged. On the top of the Makefile it includes ../../../make-rules/shared-macros.mk where ../../../ is the relative path from the component directory to the make-rules directory. The file shared-macros.mk contains global constants used by other makefiles. Sometimes some global variables that alter these constants are declared before this include. The first section of the Makefile contains definitions of the component name, version, an url where the software should be fetched from, a short description embedded in the package metadata and so on. Look, for example, at library/libjpeg6-ijg/Makefile : COMPONENT_NAME= libjpeg6-ijg COMPONENT_VERSION= 6.0.2 LIBJPEG_API_VERSION= 6b COMPONENT_FMRI= image/library/libjpeg6-ijg COMPONENT_CLASSIFICATION=System/Multimedia Libraries COMPONENT_PROJECT_URL= http://www.ijg.org/ COMPONENT_SUMMARY= libjpeg - Independent JPEG Group library version 6b COMPONENT_SRC= jpeg-$(LIBJPEG_API_VERSION) COMPONENT_ARCHIVE= $(COMPONENT_NAME)-$(COMPONENT_VERSION).tar.gz COMPONENT_ARCHIVE_HASH= \\ sha256:75c3ec241e9996504fe02a9ed4d12f16b74ade713972f3db9e65ce95cd27e35d COMPONENT_ARCHIVE_URL= http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v$(LIBJPEG_API_VERSION).tar.gz COMPONENT_LICENSE= IJG,GPLv2.0 COMPONENT_LICENSE_FILE= $(COMPONENT_NAME).license Here Variable Value Comment COMPONENT_NAME libjpeg6-ijg The name of the component, usually it's a well-known software name COMPONENT_VERSION 6.0.2 The software version. If the version contains letters, the IPS_COMPONENT_VERSION variable should define a numerical version used for the package, as the IPS version string doesn't allow for letters LIBJPEG_API_VERSION 6b In this example this is a local variable declared in the Makefile. COMPONENT_FMRI image/library/libjpeg6-ijg This variable can be used in an IPS manifest to specify the FMRI (a name) of the package. It should folllow the conventions for package FMRIs. COMPONENT_CLASSIFICATION System/Multimedia Libraries This entry should be in the OpenSolaris IPS Classification 2008 COMPONENT_PROJECT_URL http://www.ijg.org/ Upstream project website COMPONENT_SUMMARY libjpeg - Independent JPEG Group library version 6b A short description (one-liner) COMPONENT_SRC jpeg-$(LIBJPEG_API_VERSION) The name of source after unpacking the archive COMPONENT_ARCHIVE $(COMPONENT_NAME)-$(COMPONENT_VERSION).tar.gz The software archive COMPONENT_ARCHIVE_HASH sha256:75c3ec241e9996504fe02a9ed4d12f16b74ade713972f3db9e65ce95cd27e35d The SHA256 checksum of software archive COMPONENT_ARCHIVE_URL http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v$(LIBJPEG_API_VERSION).tar.gz The URI to get the COMPONENT_ARCHIVE COMPONENT_LICENSE IJG,GPLv2.0 A comma separated list of licenses COMPONENT_LICENSE_FILE $(COMPONENT_NAME).license The file with license text Components are usually based on one of the following Makefiles depending on build system used by packaged software (look in the make-rules directory for more makefiles): File Build ant.mk Ant attpackagemake.mk AT&T package tools cmake.mk CMake configure.mk Autotools gem.mk Ruby justmake.mk plain Makefile makemaker.mk Perl setup.py Python distutils Read the .mk file to see which variables you can modify, in general you can find variables such as: *_ENV *_OPTIONS PRE_*_ACTION POST_*_ACTION For example, you may add this line for an Autotools-based component: CONFIGURE_OPTIONS+= --enable-shared After creating the component Makefile you can run gmake prep . Now you can create necessary patches for the component and put them in the patches directory. When the component is built and installed correctly (via gmake build and gmake install ), look if you can run the test suite if one comes with the software. It's advised to put the expected test ouput in test/results-BITS.master (where BITS are either 32 or 64) and to ensure that the gmake test target generates reproducible results. You can use the COMPONENT_TEST_TRANSFORMS variable to set a list of sed directives to transform the test output and make it reproducible. Creating p5m files When the install target passes you can run: gmake sample-manifest to generate a manifest from the list of installed files. Copy the file manifests/sample-manifest.p5m to $(COMPONENT_NAME).p5m and edit it: Add your name as a contributor Remove unused entries from the manifest: directories: :%g/^dir/d (Vim) static libs: :%g/.a$/d (Vim) libtool files: :%g/.la$/d (Vim) Python *.pyc: :%g/.pyc$/d (Vim) For some components, specific rules need to be applied: they can be implemented with transforms . Some Makefile targets defined in make-rules/ips.mk apply transforms from files in the transforms directory at the root of oi-userland. These transforms can be used as examples if you need custom transforms for your component. Publishing packages After creating a p5m file run gmake REQUIRED_PACKAGES to automatically generate a list of run-time dependencies of the package (REQUIRED_PACKAGES section of the Makefile). Add necessary build time dependencies on the top of the generated section. Run gmake publish . If the manifest is valid your package is published to the local repository. To be able to search for the new packages in the local repository you need to rebuild search indexes: pkgrepo refresh -s /path/to/my_repo You can even rebuild the entire metadata: pkgrepo rebuild -s /path/to/my_repo Installing the package After you've published the package to your local repository and rebuilt the repository index or metadata you can install the package and perform whatever testing is appropriate. pkg publisher If the package you built and published to the local userland repository is not already part of hipster it should be straightforward to install it: pfexec pkg install your/package/name If, however, the package you built is an updated version of an existing package then you may have to take additional steps before it can be updated. If pkg refuses to install the package from your local repository it may be because the userland-incorporation is preventing updates to the version of the package: $ pfexec pkg update image/library/libjpeg6-ijg No updates available for this image. $ pfexec pkg update pkg://userland/image/library/libjpeg6-ijg@6.0.2-2018.0.0.1:20180211T125627Z pkg update: No matching version of image/library/libjpeg6-ijg can be installed: Reject: pkg://userland/image/library/libjpeg6-ijg@6.0.2-2018.0.0.1 Reason: This version is excluded by installed incorporation consolidation/userland/userland-incorporation@0.5.11-2018.0.0.11745 If you will install many test versions of packages on your development system you may find it easiest to uninstall the userland-incorporation. Alternately, if you want to test a package on a system while keeping userland-incorporation, you can use pkg change-facet to relax the version constraint for just that package: pfexec pkg change-facet facet.version-lock.your/package/name/here=false After you have performed one of these steps to remove the version constraint there is one more issue you may encounter. Because the installed version of the package came from the openindiana.org publisher but the updated version you want to install and test is associated with the userland publisher, pkg will by default not allow the package update to switch which publisher provides the package. One option to work around this is to make the openindiana.org publisher non-sticky: pfexec pkg set-publisher --non-sticky openindiana.org You only need to perform that operation on your development system once. Alternately, you can force pkg to apply an update from a different publisher by specifying the full FMRI for the package, including the publisher: pfexec pkg update pkg://userland/image/library/libjpeg6-ijg@6.0.2-2018.0.0.1:20180211T125627Z Contributing changes back to oi-userland Every time you add or modify a component, create a new branch: git checkout -b my_feature Keep this branch synchronized with upstream/oi/hipster: git pull --rebase upstream oi/hipster Your local branch is forwarded to the last commit of oi/hipster and your additional commits are kept on top of the stack. Committing changes When you think you are ready with changes you need to commit them locally and push those changes back to your Github repository. cd ~/oi-userland/components/SOFTWARE git add Makefile *.p5m <etc.> git commit Commit messages should be simple and describe what you did, e.g \"Added XYZ\", \"XYZ: updated to SOME_VERSION\", \"XYZ: fixed SOMETHING\" or \"BUG_ID BUG_SUMMARY\", where BUG_ID is issue number from issue tracker and BUG_SUMMARY is the issue name. If you've created several commits while working on your component it's necessary to squash all your commits into one. To do it, first check how many commits are to be considered: git log then git rebase -i HEAD~N with N the number of commits to be squashed and follow the instructions: the letter 's' should be put in place of 'pick' for the N - 1 commits before the last. If you made a mistake with the commit message or author, use: git commit --amend with the relevant option. Now push your changes to your repository to GitHub. git push my_name my_feature or git push -f my_name my_feature if the branch you just rebased had already been pushed: since the history is rewritten you need to force the push, be careful. Asking for change integration This is as simple as creating a Pull Request into the main oi-userland repository and asking developers to review your changeset. We should beware of possibly breaking packages as it adds additional work and can be unpleasant for other contributors (imagine a situation where gcc, perl or anything else needed for building packages is broken). Changes can be reverted quite easily but once the package is built and published additional steps are needed. So try taking per-package testing and asking for wider testing into consideration. If you contribute a package which is known to work but its functionality might be broken because of some issues, consider disabling it until the issue is removed. Checking Jenkins instance Once the changes are merged into the main oi-userland repository, the Jenkins instance will pick up those bits and build them. If the build was successful, the built packages will be pushed into http://pkg.openindiana.org/hipster repository. If the package build was unsuccessful check the build logs and please try to come up with a solution and fix the problem so you can have the package published into the repository.","title":"Building with oi-userland"},{"location":"dev/userland/#building-with-oi-userland","text":"","title":"Building with oi-userland"},{"location":"dev/userland/#using-openindianas-unified-build-system","text":"OpenIndiana Hipster's primary build framework is oi-userland.

Now you can create necessary patches for the component and put them in the patches directory. When the component is built and installed correctly (via gmake build and gmake install ), look if you can run the test suite if one comes with the software.

If pkg refuses to install the package from your local repository it may be because the userland-incorporation is preventing updates to the version of the package: $ pfexec pkg update image/library/libjpeg6-ijg No updates available for this image. $ pfexec pkg update pkg://userland/image/library/libjpeg6-ijg@6.0.2-2018.0.0.1:20180211T125627Z pkg update: No matching version of image/library/libjpeg6-ijg can be installed: Reject: pkg://userland/image/library/libjpeg6-ijg@6.0.2-2018.0.0.1 Reason: This version is excluded by installed incorporation consolidation/userland/userland-incorporation@0.5.11-2018.0.0.11745 If you will install many test versions of packages on your development system you may find it easiest to uninstall the userland-incorporation.

Because the installed version of the package came from the openindiana.org publisher but the updated version you want to install and test is associated with the userland publisher, pkg will by default not allow the package update to switch which publisher provides the package. One option to work around this is to make the openindiana.org publisher non-sticky: pfexec pkg set-publisher --non-sticky openindiana.org You only need to perform that operation on your development system once. Alternately, you can force pkg to apply an update from a different publisher by specifying the full FMRI for the package, including the publisher: pfexec pkg update pkg://userland/image/library/libjpeg6-ijg@6.0.2-2018.0.0.1:20180211T125627Z","title":"Installing the package"},{"location":"dev/userland/#contributing-changes-back-to-oi-userland","text":"","title":"Contributing changes back to oi-userland"},{"location":"dev/userland/#every-time-you-add-or-modify-a-component-create-a-new-branch","text":"git checkout -b my_feature","title":"Every time you add or modify a component, create a new branch:"},{"location":"dev/userland/#keep-this-branch-synchronized-with-upstreamoihipster","text":"git pull --rebase upstream oi/hipster Your local branch is forwarded to the last commit of oi/hipster and your additional commits are kept on top of the stack.","title":"Keep this branch synchronized with upstream/oi/hipster:"},{"location":"dev/userland/#committing-changes","text":"When you think you are ready with changes you need to commit them locally and push those changes back to your Github repository. cd ~/oi-userland/components/SOFTWARE git add Makefile *.p5m <etc.> git commit Commit messages should be simple and describe what you did, e.g \"Added XYZ\", \"XYZ: updated to SOME_VERSION\", \"XYZ: fixed SOMETHING\" or \"BUG_ID BUG_SUMMARY\", where BUG_ID is issue number from issue tracker and BUG_SUMMARY is the issue name.

Help us improve and expand this site. Please see the Contrib section for more details about joining the OpenIndiana Documentation Team. Introduction Welcome to the OpenIndiana Handbook! This collection of documents is aimed at providing a comprehensive source of guidance for both new and seasoned Unix administrators. While our aim is to address as many facets of OpenIndiana use and administration as possible, some topics are simply too complex and beyond the scope of an introductory end user handbook. In such cases external sources of information will be provided in the form of references to other web sites, man pages, or printed books. Conventions Commandlines Commandlines starting with a # character means that they should be run as root. Most of these examples can also be invoked with pfexec(1) or sudo(1m) instead. You can login as root using su(1m) . An example of a commandline intended to be invoked as root: # dd if=image.usb of=/dev/sdb Commandlines starting with a $ character means that they should be run as a regular user. An example of a commandline intended to be invoked as a regular user: $ prstat Hipster Software Releases Approximately every six months, the OpenIndiana project releases a snapshot of the Hipster rolling release branch. Ideally suited for both workstations and servers, simply choose the installer type which best serves your needs. Workstation Server Minimal Live installer (Mate desktop) Text Only (No GUI) Text Only (No GUI) For a full list of links to the various installer images, visit the OpenIndiana Downloads page. NOTE: The legacy oi-dev-151x branch is no longer maintained. For details on installing/upgrading legacy OpenIndiana dev, see this page CAUTION: Hipster is a rapid development branch where software versions are frequently updated. While every package is tested to ensure stability, caution is nevertheless warranted when deploying Hipster into mission critical production environments. System Requirements Installation type CPU Disk Space Memory (RAM) Server 64 Bit 16GB (or more) 2GB (or more) Desktop 64 Bit 20GB (or more) 4GB (or more) NOTE: For the best performance (and to reduce the possibility of disk swapping), allocate 4GB RAM or more. For desktops, ensure total system memory (RAM + swap) are at least 4GB or greater. The default size of the OpenIndiana swap file is 50% of installed memory. Minimum and maximum default swap allocations are 512MB and 32GB respectively. Exploring OpenIndiana Hipster There are several ways in which you can explore OpenIndiana without having to perform a bare metal install. Live media (USB/DVD) Virtual machines (PC emulation via software) Vagrant (virtual machine image automation) NOTE: While the Live Media environment provides an opportunity to use and explore many of the features of OpenIndiana, it is not possible to install additional software into the Live Media environment. Live Media Available in both DVD and USB formats, the OpenIndiana GUI installer also functions as live media. This allows you try OpenIndiana without the need to install it. Exploring OpenIndiana via the live media is an especially good way to test your hardware compatibility prior to installing the operating system. Virtual machines OpenIndiana is known to work with the following virtualization software: VirtualBox VMWare Fusion VMWare Workstation Pro VMWare Workstation Player VMWare VSphere Linux KVM illumos KVM - (The illumos port of Linux KVM) bhyve Virtual machines provide a PC emulation layer in which you install OpenIndiana just as you would on physical 'bare metal' hardware. Vagrant Vagrant provides an excellent way to explore OpenIndiana as it fully automates the process of bringing a virtual machine online. OpenIndiana comes with an official Vagrant box, which can be used for exploring OpenIndiana before installing it. NOTE: At this time, the OpenIndiana Vagrant box is only available in the form of a text based console. But because Vagrant supports X11 forwarding over ssh, graphical user interface applications can still be ran on this vagrant box over ssh. Additionally, Virtualbox is the only currently supported Vagrant provider. In the future the OpenIndiana project hopes to provide additional Vagrant box options. NOTE: Vagrant is officially available for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux. Vagrant is currently not packaged for OpenIndiana itself, but it can be compiled from source, and it works on OpenIndiana itself as well. Download and install the latest version of Vagrant for your platform from the official download page . Download and install the latest version of Virtualbox for your platform from the official download page . CAUTION: Older versions of Vagrant (as packaged by many LTS Linux distributions), may not support downloading the Vagrant box instance. To work around this limitation, be sure to remove any previously installed instances of Vagrant and obtain the latest Vagrant software directly from the Vagrant website. Run the following command to download and boot the OpenIndiana vagrant box: $ mkdir ~/openindiana_test $ cd ~/openindiana_test $ vagrant init openindiana/hipster $ vagrant up --provider virtualbox This will create a file titled Vagrantfile under the ~/openindiana_test directory. The Vagrant box will also be booted. Once, the Vagrant box virtual machine is online, connect to it using the following command: $ vagrant ssh To destroy the OpenIndiana Vagrant instance, issue the following command: $ vagrant destroy Preparing to Install Hipster Prior to installing OpenIndiana: Ensure your system meets the recommended hardware requirements. Ensure to consult the HCL. CAUTION: Installing OpenIndiana on unsupported hardware may cause excessive CPU usage, instability, or other problems. Please be sure to consult the hardware compatibility list (HCL): Illumos HLC OpenIndiana HCL - components OpenIndiana HCL - systems Backing up data CAUTION: Before attempting to install OpenIndiana, first ensure you backup any important data. Do not save the data on another partition or on another disk within the same system. Instead save the data to an external device such as a USB hard drive, or external system (network backup service, or a networked system). Always verify your backed up data. Deciding where to install OpenIndiana By default the OpenIndiana installer creates an EFI partition using a GPT partition table. Using this option, OpenIndiana will use the entire disk. No other operating system can share the same disk. Optionally you may use an existing zpool. Another option is to use a legacy MBR partition. MBR partitions will allow you to create multiple partitions. MBR will also support dual booting another operating system. Another option is to install to a virtual machine. Gathering network information If your network uses a DHCP server, OpenIndiana can be configured to automatically obtain it's network information. If a DHCP server is not available, then you will need to manually configure your network settings. Obtain the following information: IP address Subnet mask Gateway Network domain name Network DNS servers Downloading the software For a full list of links to the various installer images, visit the following page: OpenIndiana Downloads For a complete list of alternate mirrors (Asia, Europe, North America, etc.) OpenIndiana Download Mirrors Download example: $ wget \"http://dlc.openindiana.org/isos/hipster/20170502/OI-hipster-gui-20170502.iso\" $ wget \"http://dlc.openindiana.org/isos/hipster/20170502/OI-hipster-gui-20170502.iso.sha256sum\" Checking the MD5/SHA Checksum verification example: $ sha256sum --check OI-hipster-gui-20170502.iso.sha256sum OI-hipster-gui-20170502.iso: OK $ Creating a Hipster DVD BSD/illumos/Solaris UNIX Console The command to use for writing a CD or DVD is cdrecord . The syntax of the command is: cdrecord dev=device imagefile.iso Examples: # cdrecord dev=/dev/rdsk/c4t1d0p0 imagefile.iso # cdrecord dev=4,1,0 imagefile.iso NOTE: If you are re-using a DVD-RW, be sure to blank it first. For example: cdrecord dev=/dev/rdsk/c4t1d0p0 blank=fast Warning: Blanking the disk will destroy all data on the disk. Locating your DVD or CD writing device: For BSD, use cdrecord -scanbus to locate your device. For example: $ cdrecord -scanbus Cdrecord-ProDVD-ProBD-Clone 3.00 (i386-pc-solaris2.11) Copyright (C) 1995-2010 J\u00f6rg Schilling Warning: Using USCSI interface.

Mac OS X MAC Console # growisofs -Z /dev/dvdrw=image.iso MAC GUI Applications > Utilities > Disk Utility Windows Windows Console Isoburn is a Windows GUI utility which can be launched via the command prompt as follows: ISOBURN.EXE [/Q] [<drive letter>:] <disk image file name> Windows GUI From within Windows Explorer: Browse to and select the ISO image file Right click the ISO image file From the right click menu, select \"Burn Disk Image\" Creating a Hipster USB Drive NOTE: Old versions of OpenIndiana Hipster prior to the 2016.10 release (including legacy oi-dev-151x) require a different procedure for for creating bootable USB flash drives, see this page for details CAUTION: Although that the current OpenIndiana Hipster releases support UEFI without secure boot, old versions of OpenIndiana Hipster did not support UEFI. If you intend to install an old version of OpenIndiana Hipster on a system which supports UEFI boot, please boot the system in legacy (CSM) mode. Prerequisites USB flash drive - (2GB or larger). Download the OpenIndiana USB installer image. Identifying the path to your USB device Operating system Command Device BSD camcontrol devlist /dev/da* illumos/Solaris rmformat -l /dev/rdsk/c*t*d*p0 Linux lsblk /dev/sd* MAC OS X diskutil list /dev/disk* CAUTION: When issuing the USB copy command: Make sure you identify the correct storage device as all data on the device will be erased. Be sure to specify the entire USB device without appending any partition or slice number. For example: Example Device Correct /dev/sda Incorrect /dev/sda1 Correct /dev/rdsk/c0t0d0p0 Incorrect /dev/rdsk/c0t0d0p1 In illumos, the whole disk device name is depending on partition type. On x86, the whole disk name ends with p0 In the case of a GPT (EFI) partition, the whole disk device name ends with dX. on sparc, the disk has usually VTOC partition and whole disk device name usually ends with s2. Note, if on x86 and an MBR+VTOC is used, then the s2 device is addressing the Solaris2 MBR partition, not the whole disk. If any file systems are located on the USB storage device, they must first be unmounted. Desktops may automatically mount removable devices. As necessary, select any desktop icons for the USB device and issue an 'Eject' or 'Unmount' command. For Linux, use umount <path> . For illumos/Solaris use rmumount <path> . for MAC OS X use diskutil unmountDisk <path> . Verify using the mount command. BSD/Linux/OS X In the command below, replace X with the appropriate letter for your USB device. At least on Linux and FreeBSD you can add status=progress operand to print basic transfer statistics, refer to dd(1) man page of your platform for more information. # dd bs=4M if=./image.usb of=/dev/sdX && sync illumos/Solaris In the command below, replace each X with appropriate number for your USB device. # /usr/bin/dd if=./image.usb of=/dev/rdsk/cXtXdXpX bs=4194304 Windows Newer releases can be written using Win32 Disk Imager . NOTE: By default the Win32 Disk Imager utility is looking for .img files and won't see files with a .usb extension. To resolve this issue, be sure to select the *.* (all files) option from the file extension drop down menu. Booting the Hipster Installer Insert the bootable media (DVD or USB flash drive) and boot (start/restart) your computer. When you see the OpenIndiana boot menu, select a boot entry, and press the enter key to start OpenIndiana on your computer. As it runs, you will be prompted with a few questions. NOTE: For the computer to successfully boot from the media, you may be required to perform one of the following tasks: Specify the appropriate boot device by pressing the boot order hotkey. Change the boot device order found in your computer's system BIOS configuration. CAUTION: OpenIndiana supports UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) without secure boot: Secure boot (UEFI boot path validation) must be disabled (if it is enabled by default) because UEFI secure boot is currently not yet supported. For further information, consult the manufacturers documentation for your computer hardware. Booting the OpenIndiana installer on virtual hardware The most efficient way to boot a virtual machine is to boot directly from the DVD ISO file. Alternately, you may use host to guest DVD/USB passthrough to boot from physical media. See the notes below for optimizing OpenIndiana for several popular hypervisors. Hypervisor Configuration Notes Virtualbox OS type = Solaris 11 64-bit Vmware player OS type = Solaris 11 64-bit KVM OS type = Sun OpenSolaris Disk = SATA Remove USB Tablet NIC = e1000 sound = AC97 Processor = Copy host CPU configuration Disable CPU feature 'xsave' Video = QXL (QXL driver not supported, but the extra video memory helps) Display = VNC (Spice not supported) Hyper-V Select single CPU, generation 1 VM, and legacy NIC. NOTE: The OpenIndiana Project recommends the Oracle Virtualbox hypervisor as it provides the best support for illumos based distributions such as OpenIndiana. If you experience difficulties booting OpenIndiana on virtual hardware, or find virtual hardware devices which are either not properly recognized, or fail to function as expected, please report the problem to the upstream illumos Project. You may do so by submitting an issue using the illumos project bug tracker . The OpenIndiana installer boot menu Introduced with the Hipster 2016.10 release, the FreeBSD boot loader has been ported to OpenIndiana. The new boot loader provides many new capabilities: Booting to the first disk Single user mode Debugger options NOTE: The OpenIndiana installer will automatically boot option # 1. Boot Multi User within 10 seconds. To pause the Autoboot timer, press the Space key. The OpenIndiana installer boot menu offers multiple choices. Main Menu Option Description 1.

ACPI Toggles ACPI to ON, OFF, MADT, or Legacy 4. Single User Toggles single user mode 5. Verbose Toggles verbose boot messages 6. Reconfigure Reconfigures hardware 7. kmdb Toggles Kernel Mode Debugger 8. Debug Toggles debug Toggle (enable/disable) these options by selecting the associated number key. For example: Pressing 5 enables verbose mode. Pressing 5 again, disables the verbose option. OI Extras Menu Description 1. Back to Main Menu Returns to main menu 2. Vesa driver Forces the vesa driver 3. Text console Enables the text console 4. Enable ssh Enables ssh server for live desktop Toggle (enable/disable) these options by selecting the associated number key. For example: Pressing 2 forces the VESA driver. Pressing 2 again, disables the VESA driver. NOTE: Even when booting the Mate Live Image, selecting option # 3 (text console) option will boot the system to a text based console. The logon credentials required to access the shell are jack/jack. Selecting keyboard layout and display language OpenIndiana offers 47 different keyboard layouts. Select your keyboard layout by entering the number corresponding to your desired keyboard layout. For example, select 18 for German, or 35 for Russian, etc. The default keyboard layout is selection 47 US-English. Once you have selected a keyboard layout, press the Enter key to continue. OpenIndiana offers 22 different language options. Select a language by entering the number corresponding to your desired language. For example, select 3 for Chinese - Simplified, or 18 for Portuguese - Brazil, etc. The default language selection is 7 for English. Once you have selected a language, press the Enter key to continue. NOTE: After selecting the keyboard layout and language, OpenIndiana will begin to search for hardware and configure devices. When the configuration process is complete, the system will load to either the Mate desktop, or a logon console. The live media desktop The Live Media DVD and USB installers provide a graphical live environment where you can explore OpenIndiana and test the compatibility of your hardware. When using Live Media, no changes are made to your system unless you explicitly choose to install OpenIndiana or alter the configuration of your disk using the Gparted Partition Editor. The following options are available to you from the Live Media Desktop: Install OpenIndiana using the Text Installer Install OpenIndiana (graphical installer) Device Driver Utility Gparted Partition Editor Using the device driver utility Available from the Live Media desktop, the Device Driver Utility may be used to scan your hardware for compatibility. The utility generates a list of hardware devices along with the corresponding driver in use for each device. The utility will also show you devices for which there is no driver loaded. The device driver utility allows you to check whether your hardware requires additional drivers. Using the Gparted Partition Editor The Gparted partition editor allows you to add, remove, or resize partitions in preparation for installing OpenIndiana. CAUTION: Editing partition tables is a potentially destructive process. While you are unlikely to physically damage the disk, there is a risk of losing data. Before using the partition editor, please be sure to back up your data to a remote system or device. Live media authentication The user login for the live media session is jack along with the password jack . For administrative or elevated access, prepend your commands with sudo . You may obtain root using the su command along with the password openindiana . Installing OpenIndiana DOC TEAM NOTE: For some guidance writing this section: Installation walkthrough: web link Installation videos: web link CAUTION: Please be advised of the following important considerations: The installation overwrites the whole disk layout if one of the following is true: The disk table cannot be read. The disk was not previously partitioned. If an existing Solaris fdisk partition is on a multiboot system, and the user makes no modifications to the existing partitions, the installation overwrites the Solaris fdisk partition only. Other existing partitions are not changed. Installing OpenIndiana from live media To install OpenIndiana from Live Media, you have two options. Install OpenIndiana using the Text Installer Install OpenIndiana (graphical installer) Each of these options is represented by a desktop icon. Select the appropriate installer option by clicking the corresponding desktop installer icon. NOTE: From Hipster 2016.10 release onwards Selecting the Install OpenIndiana using the Text Installer desktop installer option provides new installation capabilities. In addition to installing OpenIndiana to single disks, the following are now also supported: Mirrors RAIDZ Yes, that's right, you can now install the rpool to logical disk arrays, created during the installation process. However, please keep in mind the following: This capability applies only to the python based installer which runs within a console window. The graphical installer does not yet have this capability. Install OpenIndiana (graphical installer) To launch the OpenIndiana graphical installer, locate and double click the desktop icon labeled: Install OpenIndiana . As shown below, and in the subsequent screens, the installer starts a new process, running within it's own window. When the installer starts, the first screen you will see is the welcome page. Please take some time to read the additional guidance provided below. When ready to begin, click the Next button to continue on with the installation process. NOTE: Please disregard the reference to the getting started guide. This guide no longer exists on the Live Media installer. A bug has been opened for this issue and a new getting started guide is being created . Also, when clicking the link for the release notes, please click it only once and wait until Firefox finishes loading. The Firefox web browser will open to the 'OpenIndiana Releases' page of the OpenIndiana Wiki. This however, is not where you will find the release notes. A bug has been opened to correct this issue . The release notes can be found on this page . The top portion of the disk selection and partitioning screen shows all the disks found on the system, including removable disks. Each disk is represented with a disk icon. Below each disk icon the installer displays the size of each disk in Gigabytes (GB) and the disk type (IDE, ATA, etc.). Within this upper panel, select the disk where you wish to install OpenIndiana. The lower portion of this screen displays partitioning options. Within the lower panel, select one of the following options: Option Description Use the whole disk When the Use the whole disk option is selected, the entire disk is used for the installation. For the selected disk, all existing partitions and any data which they may contain, will be overwritten with the OpenIndiana operating system. Partition the disk When the Partition the disk option is selected, the bottom portion of this panel displays the disk partitioning layout. Prior to selecting this option, please be sure to review all the informational notes and warnings concerning the use of the partitioning option. If you choose to partition the disk, you have additional options as shown above. Please take some time to read the additional guidance provided below. When you have revised the partitioning as needed, click the Next button to continue. NOTE: Regardless of the partitioning option chosen for the installation, manual control of the OpenIndiana file system layout is not supported. During the installation, the Solaris fdisk partition is reformatted with a default ZFS file system layout. All existing file systems on the Solaris partition are destroyed. The installation uses a Solaris fdisk partition to create a ZFS storage pool. NOTE: If you choose to partition the disk, review the following partitioning guidelines, then revise the partitioning panel settings as needed. Only one Solaris partition is allowed. If an existing Solaris partition is available, that Solaris partition will be the target for the installation. Or, if you do not have an existing Solaris partition, you can change any existing partition to a Solaris partition. You can resize existing partitions, delete partitions, and create new partitions in this panel. For this option, one existing Solaris partition must be available as the target for the installation. If you used a third-party partitioning tool such as GParted, then the Disk panel displays a partition named Linux-swap on which you can install OpenIndiana. In this panel, use the drop-down list for the Linux-swap partition name to change the partition name to Solaris. CAUTION: If the existing partition table cannot be read, a warning is displayed, and the panel displays proposed partitioning. In this case, all data on the selected disk is destroyed. If the table can be read, then the following information applies: The partitions are displayed in physically sequential order as they are laid out on the disk. Resizing a Solaris partition destroys the data on that partition and all physically subsequent partitions. Existing data is not moved to conform to a new partition layout. However, resizing the last partition or appending a new partition does not affect the data that already exists in other partitions. Non-Solaris partitions cannot be resized. To make additional space available, you can change an existing partition to Unused. However, if you change an existing partition to Unused, all subsequent non-Solaris partitions are also changed to Unused. New partitions can only use the available space that follows the last defined partition. The installer cannot utilize unallocated chunks of space between existing defined partitions. Use the fdisk(1M) command to create new partitions that use the free space between exiting partitions. This screen enables you to type the correct time zone, date, and time for the system to be installed. The top half of the panel displays a world map with major cities marked. The bottom half of the panel provides drop-down selections. You can choose the time zone either from the map or from the drop-down list. If you select the time zone from the map, click on a city or click anywhere on the map. If you click on the map, but not on a city, the map automatically magnifies that area. You can click on a location within that magnified area. You can drag the cursor to move the magnified area to a different location on the map. When you select a site on the map, the drop-down selections automatically populate with the time zone, date, and current time for that map selection. You can right-click to undo magnification. Instead of using the map, you can make your selections in the drop-down fields. Select your region, then select Location. Finally, select time zone. The options for each drop-down field are determined by the selection made in the prior drop-down field. NOTE: After making your selections, you may also edit the default date and time that is provided. When the settings are correct, click Next to continue. This screen enables you to select a language and locale. These selections determine the language support, the default date and time, and other data formats for the installed system. You can accept the default language selection or change the selection. A language selection is required. You can select \u201cno default language support.\u201d The language chosen automatically determines the available locales in the drop-down list. Only one locale can be selected. NOTE: Any time that you log in to the installed system, you can change either the locale for that particular session or the default locale by using the Options button in the Login dialog box. Review the following guidelines: Root login is not enabled either on the Live CD or on the installed system. You must log in as the user that you create in this panel. After you log in, you can then become root to configure the system. NOTE: If you do not create a user account in this panel, root is set up as a normal account on the installed system, instead of as a role. This is the only situation where you can log in to the installed system as root. Both the root password and user account are optional. However, for better security, do complete these fields. If the root password is not defined, a reminder is displayed when you click Next. If you do not want to define a root password, you can proceed. A user account requires only a Login name for the account to be valid. For better security, however, do complete all fields. If the user account information is not valid, a reminder is displayed when you click Next. If you do not want to define a user account, you can proceed. Type a computer name or accept the default. The computer name field cannot be blank. This screen summarizes the configuration options which will be used to perform the installation. Be sure to take the time to review this summary. If a configuration option needs to be changed, you may do so by clicking the Back button. If the installation options are acceptable, click the Install button to begin the installation. CAUTION: Once you have clicked the Install button, the option to Quit the installation is no longer available. Do not attempt to interrupt an installation already in progress or the system will be left in an inconsistent state. During the installation, a progress bar is displayed. The time required to complete the installation is dependent on your hardware. The final screen displays completion messages. From within this panel you may review the installation log. To view the installation log, click the link titled OpenIndiana Installation Log . The installation log will open in a new window. Using the slider located on the right side of the log viewer window, you may scroll up and down to view the entire log file. After reviewing the log, you may exit the log viewer by clicking the Close button. Congratulations! You have completed the installation of the OpenIndiana Hipster operating system. From here you now have several options: Quit the installer by clicking the Quit button and continue to explore the Live Media. Quit the installer by clicking the Quit button and then manually shut down or restart your system. Reboot the computer by clicking the Reboot button. NOTE: To prevent the Live Media from starting again after the reboot, eject the Live Media as the next boot begins. Or alternately, when presented with the Live Media installer options menu, select the ChainLoad diskN option. NOTE: After you have installed OpenIndiana, if you have another operating system installed, you might need to update the loader configuration. Usually you can achieve the desired effect by chainloading partitions with other operating systems. To configure the illumos loader to show an additional entry for chainloading another loader, create a file in /boot/conf.d directory, containing the string chain_disk=\"disk0:\" , where disk0 is the name of disk or partition to boot from. You can get the list of available disks from loader prompt using lsdev command. If you use GRUB2, you can configure it to show an entry for chainloading the illumos loader. Add the following to a file in the /etc/grub.d directory (usually the placeholder '40_custom' file can be used) of the Linux installation: menuentry \"Chainload OpenIndiana\" { set root=(hd0,2) chainloader +1 } where hd0,2 is the location of the partition or disk containing the illumos loader. You can list detected disks/partitions from the GRUB prompt using the ls command. From Linux you can run sudo fdisk -l to list disks and partitions. The partition 'sda2' would map to 'hd0,2' in GRUB. After making changes you must run sudo update-grub , this updates the auto-generated GRUB configuration stored in /boot/grub/grub.cfg. Install OpenIndiana using the Text Installer NOTE: The text based guided install starts and runs within a command line console. Navigation within the installer is performed by pressing specifically designated navigation keys ( F2 , Tab, etc.). The instructions for performing a text based install apply to the following installation scenarios: Launching the text based installer icon from the Live Media (GUI) desktop. Beginning a text based installation by booting from the OpenIndiana text based installer. From the 2016.10 release onwards Mirrors and RAIDZ are now supported install options! To install to a mirror, select 2 or more disks. To install to RAIDZ, select 3 or more disks. GUI Desktop may be added post-installation To install MATE Desktop Environment (using a metapackage) and enable graphical login pkg install mate_install pkg uninstall mate_install svcadm enable -r /application/graphical-login/lightdm init 6 The text based installation process begins with the welcome screen, which provides the following information: Location of the installation log file Navigational guidance NOTE: At any time during the installation process you may press the F6 key for context specific help. Text installer allows you to do either usual installation or installation to existing ZFS pool. If you are doing clean installation, when ready to begin, press the F2 key to continue. If you intend to install OpenIndiana to existing ZFS pool, see Install OpenIndiana to existing ZFS pool . On this screen the installer displays the disks which have been discovered and are available for installation. Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate between the disks. To select a disk, press the space bar while the disk is highlighted. A disk is selected for installation when an asterisk appears next to the disk. Once you have selected the appropriate disk, press the F2 key to continue. If your system has only a single disk, it is already selected. If your system has multiple disks, select the appropriate disk(s). To install to a mirror, select 2 or more disks. To install to RAIDZ, select 3 or more disks. NOTE: While the minimum and recommended disk sizes are technically accurate, they do not take into account periodic disk usage growth resulting from: ZFS snapshots Installation of additional software New boot environments automatically created when running the pkg update command New backup boot environments automatically created when running the pkg install command To account for this, your disk should be at least 20GB or more. After pressing the F2 key, you may be presented with warning shown above. If reformatting the entire disk is acceptable with you, press the Tab key to select continue and then press the Enter key. Otherwise press the Enter key to cancel . If you select cancel, you will have the following options: Select another disk Abort the installation so you may provide remedial action such as: Modifying the partition table using Gparted Adding another disk to the system CAUTION: If your disk contains a GPT disk label, the entire disk will be used. Any existing GPT partitions will be destroyed A new single GPT partition will be created. This warning serves as your advisory. NOTE: This screen will be available only when 2 or more disks have been selected. If 2 disks have been selected, the ZFS mirror option becomes available. If 3 or more disks have been selected, the ZFS RAIDZ option become available. Select between the options using the up and down arrow keys. When ready, press the F2 key to continue. NOTE: This screen will be available only when a single disk has been selected. In this screen you are presented with the following choices for how to partition the disk: Use the whole disk (EFI) Use a partition of the disk (MBR) Select between the options using the up and down arrow keys. When ready, press the F2 key to continue. NOTE: This screen will be available only when the Use a partition of the disk (MBR) option has been selected.

Root password Confirm Root password Real name User name User password Confirm user password Using the up and down arrow keys, navigate between the fields and enter the required information. When ready, press the F2 key to continue. NOTE The first user created on the system is granted the root role via Role Based Access Control (RBAC). In effect this means the following: Without any further configuration, the specified user will be granted the authority to perform administrative task by assuming the root role as needed. Please take note the following additional information: Immediately after installation the root password is automatically expired and needs to be changed prior to being used for any administrative task. Now that you have completed the installation configuration, you are presented with an Installation Summary . If these configuration settings are correct, you may begin the installation by pressing the F2 key. Depending on the speed of your computer, the installation may take several minutes to complete. Installation progress is measured by means of a status bar. When the installation is complete, a summary screen is presented. The installation logs are available by pressing the F4 key. If you ran the installation from Live Media, you may exit the installation by pressing the F9 key. Otherwise, you will want to reboot the system by pressing the F8 key. If you chose to view the installation logs, you will be presented with the screen above. To return to the summary screen, press the F3 key. Installing OpenIndiana using the text installer (DVD ISO or USB) The text installer DVD ISO and USB installer options are not graphical nor do they provide a live environment. When booting from the text based installer, you are presented with the following choices: Install OpenIndiana Spawn a shell to be used as a rescue disk. The procedure for installing from the text based installer follows the same process as the previously described Install OpenIndiana using the Text Installer Install OpenIndiana to existing ZFS pool Starting from OpenIndiana 2017.10, the text installer allows you to perform installation to existing ZFS pool. It will create new boot environment in the pool and install OpenIndiana there. This option can be useful when you want to do some customizations to root ZFS pool (for example, enable compression) or install OpenIndiana to pool where another operating system is already installed (for example, prior version of OpenIndiana or even FreeBSD). It is recommended to use minimal or server installation images to perform such installations. NOTE: This feature is intended for advanced users. It's assumed you know what you are doing. Multi-booting of another operating system and OpenIndiana on the same root pool can be possible, but such configuration is out of scope of this tutorial and is not supported. NOTE: OpenIndiana supports booting from a RAIDZ pool, however you must confirm that all vdevs are accessible from the boot loader. From the boot loader menu, choose Escape to loader prompt and run lsdev to confirm the disks are present. To start installation to existing ZFS pool, press F5 key when Welcome Screen is presented. Installer will present you a 'Pools' screen. On this screen installer will allow you to select the root pool for your new installation and boot environment name (which should be unique). By default installer will install OpenIndiana boot loader and activate created boot environment. If you don't want installer to touch any boot-related options, uncheck Overwrite pool's boot configuration checkbox. This can be useful when you install OpenIndiana to ZFS pool where another operating system is already installed and you want to configure boot loader manually. If you don't see your pool in the list of available pools, check /tmp/install_log . The most frequent issue is that there's not enough free space in the pool. The next steps for usual installation and installation to existing ZFS pool are the same. As there's possibly already another OS instance installed to the selected ZFS pool, no additional users or filesystems (like rpool/export ) are created during installation. Swap and dump ZFS volumes also are not created and should be added manually after installation. Only root user will be available in created boot environment. Troubleshooting Installations If you do not see a menu after booting your computer with the DVD or USB device, and instead see some text and a boot: prompt, there may be an error in your copy of the installer, or it was created incorrectly. If you see a login: prompt after selecting your keyboard and language and no desktop appears after several seconds, there may be a problem with the drivers for your graphics hardware. Please let us know via IRC or the mailing list if this happens. When you contact us, please include any error messages you see on the console, as well as the output of the svcs -xv command. If possible, also include the contents of the file /var/log/Xorg.0.log . Post Installation Steps Boot Menu - Post Install After successfully installing OpenIndiana Hipster, a new boot menu option becomes available. As shown in the screen below, option # 6 allows you to select the boot environment. Each time you perform an update of software installed on OpenIndiana Hipster, a new boot environment may be created. Option # 6 allows you to select from among them. After using OpenIndiana for a period of time, several boot environments will accumulate, with the label for each environment incrementing numerically. The image above illustrates what this looks like on a system with several boot environment choices. Resetting the root password After installation, the root password is immediately expired and you will be required to change it. Use the following steps to change the root password: Open a Terminal Execute su - and provide the password you chose for your account at installation time You will be informed that root's password has expired and prompted to change it Once changed you can exit the su session You should be able to login/authenticate as root now. Image Package System (IPS) NOTE: The image packaging system is delivered as part of the OpenIndiana userland. As such, the pkg related man pages are not available on the illumos.org website. These pages are only available by running the man page viewer locally on your system. Introduction After an initial installation of the OpenIndiana Hipster operating system, you will find many of the software applications you use on a regular basis are not immediately available to you. These software applications are available as packages in a remote Image Packaging System (IPS) repository for downloading and installing over the Internet. Written in Python, IPS is a network-centric packaging system which enables users to connect to a remote repository for the purpose of downloading and installing packages. OpenIndiana Hipster uses IPS for its packaging system. Besides installing packages from a repository, users can also perform the following tasks: Create and publish their own IPS packages Set up an OpenIndiana Hipster repository Mirror an existing repository Publish existing packages to a repository Once you have installed packages, IPS enables you to search, update, and manage those packages on your system. With IPS , you can upgrade your system to a newer build of OpenIndiana Hipster, install and update your software to the latest available versions, and retrieve packages from mirror repositories. If the system on which IPS is installed is located on a network, IPS can automatically access the OpenIndiana Hipster package repository. For OpenIndiana Hipster, your IPS client can access the packages from https://pkg.openindiana.org/hipster . IPS packages An IPS package is defined as a collection of files, directories, links, drivers and dependencies in a defined format. Note the following points about IPS packages: An IPS package consists of a set of actions. Actions are defined when an IPS package is created. Actions are used for defining the files and directories of the package, setting package attributes, declaring dependencies on other packages, creating users and groups, and installing device drivers. Some actions may optionally have tags that provide meta information about the action such as locale information and debug configuration. IPS packages can only be installed from an IPS repository. IPS package repositories can be local to the system or on a remote networked system. IPS commands The Image Packaging System software provides the following commands: Command Description pkg 1 Use the pkg 1 command to create an image, to install packages to your image, and to manage packages on your image. pkgsend 1 Use the pkgsend 1 command to publish packages from your image to an existing repository. pkg.depotd 1M Use the pkg.depotd 1M command to create and manage your own network repository or set up a mirror repositories. pkgrecv Use the pkgrecv command to download the contents of a package from a server. The user can then modify the contents by adding additional package attributes and republish the package with the pkgsend command. NOTE: The pkg 5 man page describes the overall Image Packaging System. The pkg 1 man page describes the Image Packaging System retrieval client. pkg 1 uses FMRIs Each IPS package is represented by a Fault Management Resource Identifier (FMRI). The pkg 1 command uses valid FMRI package information to perform its command actions. The FMRI includes descriptive information about the package, such as the package name, version information, and date. For example: FMRI: pkg://openindiana.org/image/editor/gimp@2.8.16-2016.0.0.0:20160702T042138Z Scheme \u2013 pkg Authority \u2013 openindiana.org PackageName \u2013 gimp Version String \u2013 Consists of three components : Build Version \u2013 2.8.16 Branch Version \u2013 2016.0.0.0 Timestamp \u2013 20160702T042138Z Finding help with pkg The primary source of help for any OpenIndiana command is to review the man page for the command. Therefore, be sure to consult the pkg 1 man page for full command information and usage examples. For example: man pkg To reference command usage directly from the command line, use pkg help . For example: pkg help Usage: pkg [options] command [cmd_options] [operands] The following commands are supported: Package Information : list search info contents Package Transitions : update install uninstall history exact-install Package Maintenance : verify fix revert Publishers : publisher set-publisher unset-publisher Package Configuration: mediator set-mediator unset-mediator facet change-facet variant change-variant Image Constraints : avoid unavoid freeze unfreeze Image Configuration : refresh rebuild-index purge-history property set-property add-property-value unset-property remove-property-value Miscellaneous : image-create dehydrate rehydrate For more info, run: pkg help <command> To retrieve information about a specific command use: pkg help [command] For example: pkg help update Usage: pkg update [-fnvq] [-C n] [-g path_or_uri ...] [--accept] [--ignore-missing] [--licenses] [--no-be-activate] [--no-index] [--no-refresh] [--no-backup-be | --require-backup-be] [--backup-be-name] [--deny-new-be | --require-new-be] [--be-name name] [-r [-z image_name ... | -Z image_name ...]] [--sync-actuators | --sync-actuators-timeout timeout] [--reject pkg_fmri_pattern ...] [pkg_fmri_pattern ...] Searching for packages The pkg search command is used to search locally or remotely for information about packages. The syntax of the command is pkg search [options] [package] . If no search options are specified, the command defaults to performing a search of all the remote repositories defined on the system. Using the -l option, you may restrict the search to the local system. For example: pkg search xchat INDEX ACTION VALUE PACKAGE pkg.summary set XChat IRC Client pkg:/desktop/irc/xchat@2.8.8-2016.0.0.5 pkg.summary set HexChat is an IRC client based on XChat pkg:/desktop/irc/hexchat@2.12.1-2016.0.0.1 basename file usr/bin/xchat pkg:/desktop/irc/xchat@2.8.8-2016.0.0.5 com.oracle.info.name set xchat pkg:/desktop/irc/xchat@2.8.8-2016.0.0.5 pkg.fmri set openindiana.org/desktop/irc/xchat pkg:/desktop/irc/xchat@2.8.8-2016.0.0.5 As you can see, the search results include package names along with additional information. To search for package names only, include the -p option. For example: pkg search -p xchat PACKAGE PUBLISHER pkg:/desktop/irc/hexchat@2.12.1-2016.0.0.1 openindiana.org pkg:/desktop/irc/xchat@2.8.8-2016.0.0.5 openindiana.org NOTE: When using the pkg search command, remember it works much like the Unix find command. If you have difficulty finding a package you know should exist, try modifying your search by including wildcards. The pkg search command may also be used to find the package containing a particular file. For example: pkg search -l /usr/bin/gpg2 INDEX ACTION VALUE PACKAGE path file usr/bin/gpg2 pkg:/crypto/gnupg@2.0.28-2016.0.0.0 Listing the status of packages To list the status of locally installed packages, use the pkg list [package] command. For example: pkg list bash NAME (PUBLISHER) VERSION IFO shell/bash 4.3.46-2016.0.0.0 i-- NOTE: To list all the packages installed on the local system, use pkg list without specifying a package. Listing information about packages To list detailed information about a locally installed package, use the pkg info [package] command. If the package is not installed on the local system, use the -r option to search the remote repositories defined on the system. For example: pkg info -r gimp Name: image/editor/gimp Summary: The Gimp image editor Category: Applications/Graphics and Imaging State: Not installed Publisher: openindiana.org Version: 2.8.16 Branch: 2016.0.0.2 Packaging Date: July 30, 2016 12:04:41 AM Size: 65.01 MB FMRI: pkg://openindiana.org/image/editor/gimp@2.8.16-2016.0.0.2:20160730T000441Z Project URL: http://www.gimp.org/ Source URL: http://download.gimp.org/pub/gimp/v2.8/gimp-2.8.16.tar.bz2 Listing the contents of packages To list the entire contents of a package, use the pkg contents [package] command. If the package is not installed on the local system, use the -r option to search the remote repositories defined on the system. Listing the dependencies of packages The pkg contents command can also be used to list the dependencies found in a package. If the package is not installed on the local system, be sure to include the -r option. For example: pkg contents -r -t depend -o fmri xchat FMRI pkg:/library/desktop/gdk-pixbuf@2.31.6-2016.0.0.0 pkg:/library/desktop/gtk2@2.24.30-2016.0.0.0 pkg:/library/desktop/libsexy@0.1.11-2016.0.0.0 pkg:/library/desktop/pango@1.36.8-2016.0.0.2 pkg:/library/glib2@2.43.4-2016.0.0.3 pkg:/library/security/openssl@1.0.2.8-2016.0.0.3 pkg:/runtime/perl-522@5.22.1-2016.0.0.1 pkg:/runtime/python-27@2.7.12-2016.0.0.0 pkg:/runtime/tcl-8@8.5.19-2016.0.0.1 pkg:/system/library/libdbus-glib@0.100.2-2016.0.0.0 pkg:/system/library@0.5.11-2016.0.0.15685 pkg:/x11/library/libx11@1.6.3-2016.0.0.0 Installing packages Use the following command to install a package. pkg install [options] [packages] Some commonly used options are: Option Description -v Issue verbose progress messages -n Perform a dry run (no actual changes are made) -q Hides progress messages For example: pkg install xchat Packages to install: 1 Packages to update: 1 Services to change: 2 Create boot environment: No Create backup boot environment: Yes DOWNLOAD PKGS FILES XFER (MB) SPEED Completed 2/2 38/38 2.6/2.6 746k/s PHASE ITEMS Removing old actions 4/4 Installing new actions 69/69 Updating modified actions 2/2 Updating package state database Done Updating package cache 1/1 Updating image state Done Creating fast lookup database Done NOTE: The pkg install command is also used to update specific packages on the system. The pkg install command automatically checks for newer versions of specific packages or package groups and installs them if they are available. Any dependent packages are also automatically updated. To install a specific version of a package you may substitute the common name for the FMRI. Updating packages The command to use for updating packages on the system is: pkg update [options] [packages] Some commonly used options are: Option Description -v Issue verbose progress messages -n Perform a dry run (no actual changes are made) -q Hides progress messages To update all the packages installed on a system to their latest available version, use the pkg update command without specifying any package names. For example: pkg update Packages to remove: 4 Packages to install: 11 Packages to update: 1018 Packages to change: 2 Mediators to change: 1 Create boot environment: Yes Create backup boot environment: No DOWNLOAD PKGS FILES XFER (MB) SPEED Completed 1035/1035 7502/7502 303.4/303.4 886k/s PHASE ITEMS Removing old actions 3931/3931 Installing new actions 6889/6889 Updating modified actions 11999/11999 Updating package state database Done Updating package cache 1022/1022 Updating image state Done Creating fast lookup database Done A clone of openindiana-1 exists and has been updated and activated. On the next boot the Boot Environment openindiana-2 will be mounted on '/'. Reboot when ready to switch to this updated BE. Removing packages To remove a package from the system, use the command: pkg uninstall [options] [packages] Downgrading packages In addition to installing, upgrading, and removing packages, it is also possible to downgrade packages. To downgrade packages, use the pkg update command and specify the versions of the packages you wish to install. Where the package has dependencies, you will need to specify the versions of the dependencies as well. The pkg utility will remove the newer versions and replace them with the versions you have specified. For example: pkg update pkg://userland/library/audio/gstreamer@0.10.36 \\ library/audio/gstreamer/plugin/base@0.10.36 \\ library/audio/gstreamer/plugin/good@0.10.31 NOTE: The OpenIndiana project uses package incorporations to ensure packages are maintained to specific versions. Where packages are included in an incorporation, it is not possible to revert to an earlier (or newer) version of the package without first relaxing the restrictions imposed by the incorporation. Where packages are not restricted by an incorporation, you may freely revert to earlier package versions. To relax the restrictions on a package, the pkg change-facet command is used. The syntax of the command is pkg change-facet facet.version-lock.[package]=false For example: pkg change-facet facet.version-lock.library/security/gstreamer=false IPS package repositories As previously mentioned, the IPS repository is the remote network location where IPS packages reside. Below is a list of commands for adding, removing, or replacing repositories.

It can also be used for querying the contents of a repository. For example: pkgrepo info -s https://pkg.openindiana.org/hipster/ PUBLISHER PACKAGES STATUS UPDATED openindiana.org 3692 online 2016-08-21T07:03:11.566484Z If you want to directly query the remote repository for a full list of all available packages, you can do so using the pkgrepo list command. pkgrepo list -s <repo_URL> Do keep in mind you may want to filter the output of the command in some way to keep the list more manageable. If not, you're likely to see thousands of lines scroll through your console window. IPS package repository precedence When multiple remote IPS repositories are associated with a system and when using the pkg command-line interface with only package names, the following rules apply. These rules can be overridden by using explicit publishers and package version numbers. Package Installation Type Rules When Only Package Names Are Provided New package installations The latest available version of new packages are always installed from the preferred publisher unless the publisher is provided in the FMRI during installation. Even if later versions of the package are available in other publishers, those later versions are not installed by default. Package updates: package originally installed from preferred publisher If the package was originally installed from the preferred publisher, then the latest available update of the package can be installed from the current preferred publisher. The package can be install from the current preferred even if the preferred publisher designation had been moved to another publisher after the package had been originally installed. Even if later versions of the package are available in other publishers, those later versions are not installed by default. Package updates: package originally installed from non-preferred publisher If the package was originally installed from a non-preferred publisher, then the latest available update of the package is installed from the publisher from which the package was originally installed. Even if later versions of the package are available in other publishers, those later versions are not installed by default. Listing package history To list the IPS transactional history, use the pkg history command. For example: pkg history START OPERATION CLIENT OUTCOME 2016-04-21T03:30:04 purge-history pkg Succeeded 2016-07-02T16:09:56 uninstall pkg Succeeded 2016-07-02T16:10:33 uninstall pkg Succeeded 2016-07-02T16:11:08 uninstall pkg Succeeded 2016-07-02T16:11:42 uninstall pkg Succeeded 2016-07-02T16:12:18 set-property pkg Succeeded 2016-07-02T16:12:22 set-property pkg Succeeded 2016-07-02T16:37:06 refresh-publishers pkg Succeeded 2016-07-02T16:37:06 update pkg Succeeded 2016-07-02T16:37:32 rebuild-image-catalogs pkg Succeeded 2016-07-02T17:33:44 install pkg Succeeded 2016-07-02T17:35:11 install pkg Succeeded 2016-07-02T18:31:39 install pkg Succeeded 2016-07-04T19:49:19 install pkg Succeeded 2016-07-04T19:49:23 refresh-publishers pkg Succeeded 2016-07-04T19:49:56 rebuild-image-catalogs pkg Succeeded 2016-07-09T01:16:43 install pkg Succeeded 2016-07-09T01:16:45 refresh-publishers pkg Succeeded 2016-07-09T01:17:20 rebuild-image-catalogs pkg Succeeded 2016-07-09T11:33:05 install pkg Succeeded 2016-07-09T11:33:07 refresh-publishers pkg Succeeded 2016-07-09T11:33:37 rebuild-image-catalogs pkg Succeeded 2016-07-09T12:27:23 update pkg Succeeded To view more details of a particular IPS transaction, use the command: pkg history [-l] [-t time_stamp] For example: pkg history -l -t 2016-07-09T11:33:05 The -l option provides comprehensive details of each transaction The -t option allows you to specify a particular transaction IPS package archives (.p5p) When the IPS system was originally conceived there was no standard on-disk format for an IPS package. Hence, unlike a .rpm file, an SVR4 package, or a .nbm file, it was not possible to transfer IPS packages from system to system. The remote IPS repository where the IPS package resided was the only source for the package. This is because in its native state, the IPS package is not something you can normally download as a single archive file. Recognizing this limitation of IPS, the .p5p IPS archive format was developed. For IPS archives, files are stored in the pax archive format, along with additional metadata, such as IPS manifest files, and a specific layout of the contents. IPS p5p archives are not like Linux packages where you can install software directly from the package. Instead p5p archives are a portable repository format containing a collection of packages. This allows you to create p5p archives for transfer to non-networked systems. IPS package archives are also useful for sharing packages for the purpose of testing. IPS archives allow you to: Download one or more packages (along with all necessary dependencies) into a p5p archive file. Create a local repository based on the contents of the p5p archive file. Install packages from the locally created repository. Creating the p5p package To create an IPS archive, the pkgrecv command is used. For example, to create a .p5p IPS package archive containing the package userland/web/browser/firefox and all of its dependencies from the repository located at http://example.com:10000 , use the following command: pkgrecv -s http://example.com:10000 -d ~/firefox_test.p5p -a -r pkg://userland/web/browser/firefox@45.3.0-2016.0.0.0:20160817T064143Z Listing the contents of a p5p package There are at least two different ways to view the contents of an IPS archive. pkgrepo -s ~/firefox_test.p5p list PUBLISHER NAME O VERSION userland library/expat 2.1.0-2015.0.1.1:20150901T125810Z userland library/glib2 2.43.4-2016.0.0.4:20160705T121550Z userland library/glib2/charset-alias 2.43.4-2016.0.0.4:20160705T121609Z userland system/library/fontconfig 2.11.95-2016.0.0.0:20160512T122747Z userland web/browser/firefox 45.3.0-2016.0.0.0:20160817T064143Z userland x11/library/toolkit/libxt 1.1.4-2016.0.0.0:20160706T165209Z This also works: pkg list -f -g ~/firefox_test.p5p NAME (PUBLISHER) VERSION IFO library/expat (userland) 2.1.0-2015.0.1.1 --- library/glib2 (userland) 2.43.4-2016.0.0.4 --- library/glib2/charset-alias (userland) 2.43.4-2016.0.0.4 --- system/library/fontconfig (userland) 2.11.95-2016.0.0.0 --- web/browser/firefox (userland) 45.3.0-2016.0.0.0 --- x11/library/toolkit/libxt (userland) 1.1.4-2016.0.0.0 --- Adding the package as a local repository pkg set-publisher -p firefox_test.p5p Installing software from the local repository pkg install firefox@45.3.0-2016.0.0.0:20160817T064143 Legacy package management tools OpenIndiana continues to support the use of legacy package tools for managing SVR4 packages. Here are some of the available tools: pkginfo pkgadd pkgrm 3rd party package management tools DOC TEAM NOTE: ITEMS TO WRITE ABOUT: Need to answer the question \u201cWhere and how can I install more software?\u201d Discuss 3rd party package managers ( pkgin , etc.) Discuss the various 3rd party repos, what's available in them, and which might break compatibility, etc.: pkgsrc ( wiki page , NetBSD wiki page ) Joyent's pkgsrc binary packages ( install on illumos , wiki page ) opencsw SFE (spec-files-extra) ( wiki page , other wiki page ): describe and explain how it differs from OI and other repos. How to add additional repos, etc. How to compile your own software. Existing wiki pages: Knowledge base , Compiling software on OpenIndiana Also could look here (might be outdated): Compiling Software on Solaris Given the limited number of IPS packages currently available, these are pretty important subjects to write about. In addition to IPS and SVR4 package management tools, it is also possible to use pkgsrc . For more information about pkgsrc, see the Joyent package source website . CAUTION: The use of 3rd party repositories and package managers increases the likelihood of conflicts between package versions and their dependencies. Furthermore, the OpenIndiana project cannot guarantee the qualify of packages obtained from 3rd party repositories. Therefore, use 3rd party repositories and 3rd party package tools at your own risk. Managing Boot Environments A boot environment is a bootable instance of an OpenIndiana operating system image plus any other application software packages installed into that image. You can maintain multiple boot environments on your system, and each boot environment could have different software versions installed. Upon the initial installation of OpenIndiana onto your system, a boot environment is created. Use the beadm 1M utility to administer additional boot environments on your system. The beadm utility is designed to work in concert with the ZFS file system and the IPS package manager. Why use multiple boot environments? With multiple boot environments, the process of updating software becomes a low risk operation because you can create backup boot environments before making any software updates to your system. If needed, you have the option of booting a backup boot environment. Here are some specific examples where having more than one OpenIndiana boot environment, and managing them with the beadm utility, is useful: When you use the pkg update command to update all the packages in your active OpenIndiana boot environment, this process automatically creates a clone of that boot environment. The packages are updated in the clone rather than in the original boot environment. After successfully completing the updates, the new clone is activated. Then, the clone will become the new default boot environment on the next reboot. You can boot the original boot environment explicitly selecting it from loader menu. beadm list command can be used to see a list of all boot environments on the system, including the backup boot environment that still has its original, unchanged software. If you are not satisfied with the updates made to the environment, you can use the beadm activate command to specify that the backup will become the default boot environment on the next reboot. If you are modifying a boot environment, you can take a snapshot of that environment at any stage during modifications by using the beadm create command. A snapshot is a read-only image of a dataset or boot environment at a given point in time. You can create custom names for each snapshot that identify when or why the snapshot was created. For example, if you are doing monthly upgrades to your boot environment, you can capture snapshots for each monthly upgrade. You can use the beadm list -s command to view the available snapshots for a boot environment. A snapshot is not bootable. But, you can create a boot environment, based on that snapshot, by using the -e option for the beadm create command. Then you can use the beadm activate command to specify that this boot environment will become the default boot environment on the next reboot. You can maintain more than one boot environment on your system, and perform various upgrades on each of them as needed. For example, you can clone a boot environment by using the beadm create command. A clone is a bootable copy of a boot environment. Then, you can install, test, and update different software packages on the original boot environment and on its clone. Although only one boot environment can be active at a time, you can mount an inactive boot environment by using the beadm mount command. Then you can use the pkg update command with the -R option to update all the packages in that inactive, mounted environment. Or, use the pkg install packagename with the -R option to update specific packages on that environment. When `pkg` creates new boot environment, it determines its name using `auto-be-name` image property. When prefixed with \"time:\" string, the remaining part of property is interpreted as `strftime(3C)` argument. If `pkg` can't produce unique boot environment name based on auto-be-name image property, it uses the property as base to generate unique name, appending numerical suffix prefixed by \"-\" symbol. Note, that due to name generation rules, any numerical suffix, prefixed by \"-\", can be incremented to generate unique name, so given \"time:openindiana-%Y-%m-%d\" `auto-be-name image` property value (which is not recommended), `pkg` will produce boot environment names ending with current date, current date + 1 and so on. By default `auto-be-name` is set to \"time:openindiana-%Y:%m:%d\", so that boot environments are named like \"openindiana-2019:03:29\". You can get current value using `pkg property` command and set it with `pkg set-property`. Features of the beadm utility The beadm utility has the following features: The beadm utility aggregates all datasets in a boot environment and performs actions on the entire boot environment at once. You no longer need to perform ZFS commands to modify each dataset individually. The beadm utility manages the dataset structures within boot environments. For example, when the beadm utility clones a boot environment that has shared datasets, the utility automatically recognizes and manages those shared datasets for the new boot environment. The beadm utility enables you to perform administrative tasks on your boot environments. These tasks can be performed without upgrading your system. The beadm utility manages and updates the <root pool>/boot/menu.lst file used by loader to list boot environments. When you use the beadm utility to create a new boot environment, that environment is automatically added to this file. The beadm utility enables you to perform the following tasks: Create a new boot environment based on the active boot environment Create a new boot environment based on an inactive boot environment Create a snapshot of an existing boot environment Create a new boot environment based on an existing snapshot Activate an existing, inactive boot environment Mount a boot environment Unmount a boot environment Destroy a boot environment Destroy a snapshot of a boot environment Rename an existing, inactive boot environment Display information about your boot environment snapshots and datasets beadm command reference Command Description beadm Displays command usage beadm activate <BE> Makes the specified boot environment the active boot environment upon the next reboot. beadm create <BE> Creates a new boot environment with the name specified. Unless the -e option is provided, the new boot environment is created as a clone of the currently running boot environment. beadm create <BE@snapshot> Creates a snapshot of the existing boot environment with the specified snapshot name. beadm destroy <BE> Destroys the boot environment named BE or destroys an existing snapshot, BE@snapshot, of a boot environment. Prompts for confirmation before destroying the boot environment. beadm list <BE> Lists information about the specified boot environment, or lists information for all boot environments if a boot environment name is not provided. The default is to list boot environments without any additional information. beadm mount <BE> <mountpoint> Mounts the specified boot environment at the specified mount point. The mount point must be an already existing, empty directory. beadm rename <old BE> <new BE> Renames the specified boot environment. beadm unmount [-f] <BE> Unmounts the specified boot environment. -f \u2013 Forcefully unmounts the boot environment even if it is currently busy. For detailed instructions about the beadm utility, see the beadm 1M man page. beadm zones support Zones partitioning technology is used to virtualize operating system services and provide an isolated and secure environment for running applications. Each OpenIndiana system is a global zone. Within a global zone, specific non-global zones can be created. Zones support limitations Note the following limitations of support for non-global zones in the beadm utility and in related processes: When using the pkg update command, the -r switch is required to upgrade all zones. Non-global zone support is limited to ZFS support. Zones are not supported unless they are on ZFS. Zones are not supported in the rpool/ROOT namespace. Non-global zones are cloned or copied only when the original zone is within the shared area for the global zone, for example, within rpool/export or within rpool/zones. Although the beadm utility affects the non-global zones on your system, the beadm utility does not display zones information. Use the zoneadm utility to view changes in the zones in your boot environment. For example, use the zoneadm list command to view a list of all current zones on the system. For further information, see the zoneadm 1M man page. Zones support specifications The beadm command impacts the non-global zones in your boot environments as follows: Command Support Details beadm create When you clone a boot environment by using the beadm create command, all zones in that boot environment are copied into the new boot environment. beadm destroy When you destroy an inactive boot environment, the zones that belong to that boot environment are also destroyed. beadm mount When you mount a boot environment, the zones in that environment are mounted relative to the mount points for the environment. beadm unmount When you unmount a boot environment, the zones in that environment are also unmounted. All mount points are returned to their states prior to being mounted. beadm rename When you rename a boot environment, that change does not impact the names of the zones or the names of the datasets that are used for those zones in that boot environment. The change does not impact the relationships between the zones and their related boot environments. The X-Window System DOC TEAM NOTE: Write about: How to create and use an xorg.conf file.

The Firefox web browser will open to the 'OpenIndiana Releases' page of the OpenIndiana Wiki. This however, is not where you will find the release notes. A bug has been opened to correct this issue . The release notes can be found on this page . The top portion of the disk selection and partitioning screen shows all the disks found on the system, including removable disks. Each disk is represented with a disk icon. Below each disk icon the installer displays the size of each disk in Gigabytes (GB) and the disk type (IDE, ATA, etc.). Within this upper panel, select the disk where you wish to install OpenIndiana. The lower portion of this screen displays partitioning options. Within the lower panel, select one of the following options: Option Description Use the whole disk When the Use the whole disk option is selected, the entire disk is used for the installation. For the selected disk, all existing partitions and any data which they may contain, will be overwritten with the OpenIndiana operating system. Partition the disk When the Partition the disk option is selected, the bottom portion of this panel displays the disk partitioning layout. Prior to selecting this option, please be sure to review all the informational notes and warnings concerning the use of the partitioning option. If you choose to partition the disk, you have additional options as shown above. Please take some time to read the additional guidance provided below. When you have revised the partitioning as needed, click the Next button to continue. NOTE: Regardless of the partitioning option chosen for the installation, manual control of the OpenIndiana file system layout is not supported. During the installation, the Solaris fdisk partition is reformatted with a default ZFS file system layout. All existing file systems on the Solaris partition are destroyed. The installation uses a Solaris fdisk partition to create a ZFS storage pool. NOTE: If you choose to partition the disk, review the following partitioning guidelines, then revise the partitioning panel settings as needed. Only one Solaris partition is allowed. If an existing Solaris partition is available, that Solaris partition will be the target for the installation. Or, if you do not have an existing Solaris partition, you can change any existing partition to a Solaris partition. You can resize existing partitions, delete partitions, and create new partitions in this panel. For this option, one existing Solaris partition must be available as the target for the installation. If you used a third-party partitioning tool such as GParted, then the Disk panel displays a partition named Linux-swap on which you can install OpenIndiana. In this panel, use the drop-down list for the Linux-swap partition name to change the partition name to Solaris. CAUTION: If the existing partition table cannot be read, a warning is displayed, and the panel displays proposed partitioning. In this case, all data on the selected disk is destroyed. If the table can be read, then the following information applies: The partitions are displayed in physically sequential order as they are laid out on the disk. Resizing a Solaris partition destroys the data on that partition and all physically subsequent partitions. Existing data is not moved to conform to a new partition layout. However, resizing the last partition or appending a new partition does not affect the data that already exists in other partitions. Non-Solaris partitions cannot be resized. To make additional space available, you can change an existing partition to Unused. However, if you change an existing partition to Unused, all subsequent non-Solaris partitions are also changed to Unused. New partitions can only use the available space that follows the last defined partition. The installer cannot utilize unallocated chunks of space between existing defined partitions. Use the fdisk(1M) command to create new partitions that use the free space between exiting partitions. This screen enables you to type the correct time zone, date, and time for the system to be installed. The top half of the panel displays a world map with major cities marked. The bottom half of the panel provides drop-down selections. You can choose the time zone either from the map or from the drop-down list. If you select the time zone from the map, click on a city or click anywhere on the map. If you click on the map, but not on a city, the map automatically magnifies that area. You can click on a location within that magnified area. You can drag the cursor to move the magnified area to a different location on the map. When you select a site on the map, the drop-down selections automatically populate with the time zone, date, and current time for that map selection. You can right-click to undo magnification. Instead of using the map, you can make your selections in the drop-down fields. Select your region, then select Location. Finally, select time zone. The options for each drop-down field are determined by the selection made in the prior drop-down field. NOTE: After making your selections, you may also edit the default date and time that is provided. When the settings are correct, click Next to continue. This screen enables you to select a language and locale. These selections determine the language support, the default date and time, and other data formats for the installed system. You can accept the default language selection or change the selection. A language selection is required. You can select \u201cno default language support.\u201d The language chosen automatically determines the available locales in the drop-down list. Only one locale can be selected. NOTE: Any time that you log in to the installed system, you can change either the locale for that particular session or the default locale by using the Options button in the Login dialog box. Review the following guidelines: Root login is not enabled either on the Live CD or on the installed system. You must log in as the user that you create in this panel. After you log in, you can then become root to configure the system. NOTE: If you do not create a user account in this panel, root is set up as a normal account on the installed system, instead of as a role. This is the only situation where you can log in to the installed system as root. Both the root password and user account are optional. However, for better security, do complete these fields. If the root password is not defined, a reminder is displayed when you click Next. If you do not want to define a root password, you can proceed. A user account requires only a Login name for the account to be valid. For better security, however, do complete all fields. If the user account information is not valid, a reminder is displayed when you click Next. If you do not want to define a user account, you can proceed. Type a computer name or accept the default. The computer name field cannot be blank. This screen summarizes the configuration options which will be used to perform the installation. Be sure to take the time to review this summary. If a configuration option needs to be changed, you may do so by clicking the Back button. If the installation options are acceptable, click the Install button to begin the installation. CAUTION: Once you have clicked the Install button, the option to Quit the installation is no longer available. Do not attempt to interrupt an installation already in progress or the system will be left in an inconsistent state. During the installation, a progress bar is displayed. The time required to complete the installation is dependent on your hardware. The final screen displays completion messages. From within this panel you may review the installation log. To view the installation log, click the link titled OpenIndiana Installation Log . The installation log will open in a new window. Using the slider located on the right side of the log viewer window, you may scroll up and down to view the entire log file. After reviewing the log, you may exit the log viewer by clicking the Close button. Congratulations! You have completed the installation of the OpenIndiana Hipster operating system. From here you now have several options: Quit the installer by clicking the Quit button and continue to explore the Live Media. Quit the installer by clicking the Quit button and then manually shut down or restart your system. Reboot the computer by clicking the Reboot button. NOTE: To prevent the Live Media from starting again after the reboot, eject the Live Media as the next boot begins. Or alternately, when presented with the Live Media installer options menu, select the ChainLoad diskN option. NOTE: After you have installed OpenIndiana, if you have another operating system installed, you might need to update the loader configuration. Usually you can achieve the desired effect by chainloading partitions with other operating systems. To configure the illumos loader to show an additional entry for chainloading another loader, create a file in /boot/conf.d directory, containing the string chain_disk=\"disk0:\" , where disk0 is the name of disk or partition to boot from. You can get the list of available disks from loader prompt using lsdev command. If you use GRUB2, you can configure it to show an entry for chainloading the illumos loader. Add the following to a file in the /etc/grub.d directory (usually the placeholder '40_custom' file can be used) of the Linux installation: menuentry \"Chainload OpenIndiana\" { set root=(hd0,2) chainloader +1 } where hd0,2 is the location of the partition or disk containing the illumos loader. You can list detected disks/partitions from the GRUB prompt using the ls command. From Linux you can run sudo fdisk -l to list disks and partitions. The partition 'sda2' would map to 'hd0,2' in GRUB. After making changes you must run sudo update-grub , this updates the auto-generated GRUB configuration stored in /boot/grub/grub.cfg.","title":"Install OpenIndiana (graphical installer)"},{"location":"handbook/getting-started/#install-openindiana-using-the-text-installer","text":"NOTE: The text based guided install starts and runs within a command line console.

Written in Python, IPS is a network-centric packaging system which enables users to connect to a remote repository for the purpose of downloading and installing packages. OpenIndiana Hipster uses IPS for its packaging system. Besides installing packages from a repository, users can also perform the following tasks: Create and publish their own IPS packages Set up an OpenIndiana Hipster repository Mirror an existing repository Publish existing packages to a repository Once you have installed packages, IPS enables you to search, update, and manage those packages on your system. With IPS , you can upgrade your system to a newer build of OpenIndiana Hipster, install and update your software to the latest available versions, and retrieve packages from mirror repositories. If the system on which IPS is installed is located on a network, IPS can automatically access the OpenIndiana Hipster package repository.

Actions are used for defining the files and directories of the package, setting package attributes, declaring dependencies on other packages, creating users and groups, and installing device drivers. Some actions may optionally have tags that provide meta information about the action such as locale information and debug configuration. IPS packages can only be installed from an IPS repository.

This is because in its native state, the IPS package is not something you can normally download as a single archive file. Recognizing this limitation of IPS, the .p5p IPS archive format was developed. For IPS archives, files are stored in the pax archive format, along with additional metadata, such as IPS manifest files, and a specific layout of the contents. IPS p5p archives are not like Linux packages where you can install software directly from the package. Instead p5p archives are a portable repository format containing a collection of packages. This allows you to create p5p archives for transfer to non-networked systems. IPS package archives are also useful for sharing packages for the purpose of testing.

If needed, you have the option of booting a backup boot environment. Here are some specific examples where having more than one OpenIndiana boot environment, and managing them with the beadm utility, is useful: When you use the pkg update command to update all the packages in your active OpenIndiana boot environment, this process automatically creates a clone of that boot environment. The packages are updated in the clone rather than in the original boot environment. After successfully completing the updates, the new clone is activated. Then, the clone will become the new default boot environment on the next reboot. You can boot the original boot environment explicitly selecting it from loader menu. beadm list command can be used to see a list of all boot environments on the system, including the backup boot environment that still has its original, unchanged software. If you are not satisfied with the updates made to the environment, you can use the beadm activate command to specify that the backup will become the default boot environment on the next reboot. If you are modifying a boot environment, you can take a snapshot of that environment at any stage during modifications by using the beadm create command. A snapshot is a read-only image of a dataset or boot environment at a given point in time. You can create custom names for each snapshot that identify when or why the snapshot was created. For example, if you are doing monthly upgrades to your boot environment, you can capture snapshots for each monthly upgrade. You can use the beadm list -s command to view the available snapshots for a boot environment. A snapshot is not bootable. But, you can create a boot environment, based on that snapshot, by using the -e option for the beadm create command. Then you can use the beadm activate command to specify that this boot environment will become the default boot environment on the next reboot. You can maintain more than one boot environment on your system, and perform various upgrades on each of them as needed. For example, you can clone a boot environment by using the beadm create command. A clone is a bootable copy of a boot environment. Then, you can install, test, and update different software packages on the original boot environment and on its clone. Although only one boot environment can be active at a time, you can mount an inactive boot environment by using the beadm mount command. Then you can use the pkg update command with the -R option to update all the packages in that inactive, mounted environment. Or, use the pkg install packagename with the -R option to update specific packages on that environment. When `pkg` creates new boot environment, it determines its name using `auto-be-name` image property. When prefixed with \"time:\" string, the remaining part of property is interpreted as `strftime(3C)` argument. If `pkg` can't produce unique boot environment name based on auto-be-name image property, it uses the property as base to generate unique name, appending numerical suffix prefixed by \"-\" symbol. Note, that due to name generation rules, any numerical suffix, prefixed by \"-\", can be incremented to generate unique name, so given \"time:openindiana-%Y-%m-%d\" `auto-be-name image` property value (which is not recommended), `pkg` will produce boot environment names ending with current date, current date + 1 and so on.

Firewall can protect your personal computer or whole company's network from unauthorized network while allowing passage of legitimate network traffic. IP Filter OpenIndiana comes with built-in firewall, IP Filter. IP Filter is the stateful packet filtering and network address translation (NAT) mechanism. IP filter can filter any kind of traffic based on source or destination IP address or pool of IP addresses, source or destination ports, interface or direction of the network traffic. OpenIndiana IP Filter is derived from open source IPFilter software. NOTE: To manage IP Filter rules one must assume a role that includes IP Filter Management profile rights or superuser ( root ). IP Filter configuration IP Filter is configured by loadable configurations files stored in /etc/ipf . One can create several configuration files in /etc/ipf for firewall configuration: ipf.conf - stores packet filtering rules ipnat.conf - defines NAT rules ippol.conf - address pool configuration If IP Filter SMF service is enabled then the configured rules will be automatically loaded at every boot time of the operating system. Packet Filtering IP Filter ruleset can be configured with the ipf(1M) or /etc/ipf/ipf.conf file. Rules are processed by the \"the last matching rule wins\" logic. This means that packet passing the IP Filter ruleset from the beggining and the action of the last rule that matched the packet is applied. There are two exceptions, which change this processing. The first one is the use of quick keyword, which will apply the rule on the packet and stop further filter rules checks. Another exception is the group keyword, which matches packet. Only rules with group keyword are used for packet processing. Filtering rules syntax The following format is used to create filtering rules: action [in|out] option keyword, keyword.. Every rule begins with the action. Action can be one of these: block - denies packets from passing the filter pass - allows packets to pass the filter log - logs the packet. ipmon(1M) is used to view the log file. count - counts packet into the filter statistics. Use ipfstat(1M) to display the statistics. skip number - skips the filter over number filtering rules auth - user program is requested to perform packet authentification in order to decide if the packet should be passed or not Following the action, the next word is in or out . This determines in which direction rules are applied, e.g incoming or outgoing packets. The option keyword is next. One can choose from: log - logs the packet is the packet matched the rule. Use ipmon(1M) to view the log. quick - rule with quick keyword is executed if packet matches it. No further rules checking is done. on interface - rule is applied only on interface in both directions dup-to interface - packet is copied and sent out on interface to specified IP address to interface - packet is moved to an outbound queue on interface Next are the keywords that determine if the packet matches the rule. The following keywords shown here can be used: tos - packet is filtered based on the type-of-service value written as decimal or hexadecimal integer. ttl - packet is matched based on its time-to-live value. proto - used to match a specific protocol. Any protocol name from /etc/protocols or its decimal representation can be used. from/to/all/any - matches either source or destination IP address of the packet and the port number. All accepts packet from any source to any destination. with - matches specified attributes associated with the packet. Inserted not/no in front of the keyword matches the packet only if the option is not present. flags - filters based on TCP flags that are set. icmp-type - filters based on ICMP type. keep keep-options - determines whetever state should be kept for a packet. state stores information about the session and can be kept on TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets. The frags keeps information about packet fragments and apllies them to later fragments. This option allows matching packets to pass without further ruleset evalution. head number - creates new group for filtering rules denoted by number. group number - adds the rule to group number. The default group value is 0. In the following example we will block all incoming packet on igb0 from 10.0.0.0/8. This rule should be included in one's ruleset: block in quick on igb0 from 10.0.0.0/8 to any Address pools Address pools group multiple IP addresses/networks into a single reference that can be used in IP Filter rules. NAT (Network Address Translation) NAT is used in case when one needs to do address or port translation. This happens when one wants to connect multiple computers at home and share the network connection or when one wants to do port forwarding. NAT on OpenIndiana is set up in /etc/ipf/ipnat.conf and work regarding NATs is done with ipnat(1M) . NAT rules syntax To create NAT rules use the following syntax: command interface-name parameters Every rule begins with command from one of these: map - maps one IP address or network to another IP address or network. rdr - redirects packet from one IP address and port to another IP address and port. bimap - creates bidirectorial NAT between an external and an internal IP address. map-block - establishes static IP address-based translation. Interface named is used after command, e.g. igb0 . To determine NAT configuration one has to use one of the following parameters: ipmask - designates the network mask. dstipmask - designates the address ipmask is translated to. mapport - designates TCP or UDP protocols along with range of ports. Assuming we have an external IP address 10.0.0.1/24 on interface eg1000 and an internal range of 192.168.1.0/24. The example NAT rule would look like this: map eg1000 192.168.0.0/24 -> 10.0.0.1/24 NOTE: NAT is not usable with IPv6 IP filter as NAT is deprecated in IPv6. NAT can be only used with IPv4 addresses.

IP Filter is the stateful packet filtering and network address translation (NAT) mechanism. IP filter can filter any kind of traffic based on source or destination IP address or pool of IP addresses, source or destination ports, interface or direction of the network traffic. OpenIndiana IP Filter is derived from open source IPFilter software. NOTE: To manage IP Filter rules one must assume a role that includes IP Filter Management profile rights or superuser ( root ).","title":"IP Filter"},{"location":"handbook/network-communications/#ip-filter-configuration","text":"IP Filter is configured by loadable configurations files stored in /etc/ipf . One can create several configuration files in /etc/ipf for firewall configuration: ipf.conf - stores packet filtering rules ipnat.conf - defines NAT rules ippol.conf - address pool configuration If IP Filter SMF service is enabled then the configured rules will be automatically loaded at every boot time of the operating system.","title":"IP Filter configuration"},{"location":"handbook/network-communications/#packet-filtering","text":"IP Filter ruleset can be configured with the ipf(1M) or /etc/ipf/ipf.conf file. Rules are processed by the \"the last matching rule wins\" logic. This means that packet passing the IP Filter ruleset from the beggining and the action of the last rule that matched the packet is applied. There are two exceptions, which change this processing. The first one is the use of quick keyword, which will apply the rule on the packet and stop further filter rules checks. Another exception is the group keyword, which matches packet. Only rules with group keyword are used for packet processing.","title":"Packet Filtering"},{"location":"handbook/network-communications/#filtering-rules-syntax","text":"The following format is used to create filtering rules: action [in|out] option keyword, keyword.. Every rule begins with the action. Action can be one of these: block - denies packets from passing the filter pass - allows packets to pass the filter log - logs the packet. ipmon(1M) is used to view the log file. count - counts packet into the filter statistics. Use ipfstat(1M) to display the statistics. skip number - skips the filter over number filtering rules auth - user program is requested to perform packet authentification in order to decide if the packet should be passed or not Following the action, the next word is in or out . This determines in which direction rules are applied, e.g incoming or outgoing packets. The option keyword is next. One can choose from: log - logs the packet is the packet matched the rule. Use ipmon(1M) to view the log. quick - rule with quick keyword is executed if packet matches it. No further rules checking is done. on interface - rule is applied only on interface in both directions dup-to interface - packet is copied and sent out on interface to specified IP address to interface - packet is moved to an outbound queue on interface Next are the keywords that determine if the packet matches the rule. The following keywords shown here can be used: tos - packet is filtered based on the type-of-service value written as decimal or hexadecimal integer. ttl - packet is matched based on its time-to-live value. proto - used to match a specific protocol. Any protocol name from /etc/protocols or its decimal representation can be used. from/to/all/any - matches either source or destination IP address of the packet and the port number. All accepts packet from any source to any destination. with - matches specified attributes associated with the packet. Inserted not/no in front of the keyword matches the packet only if the option is not present. flags - filters based on TCP flags that are set. icmp-type - filters based on ICMP type. keep keep-options - determines whetever state should be kept for a packet. state stores information about the session and can be kept on TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets. The frags keeps information about packet fragments and apllies them to later fragments. This option allows matching packets to pass without further ruleset evalution. head number - creates new group for filtering rules denoted by number. group number - adds the rule to group number. The default group value is 0. In the following example we will block all incoming packet on igb0 from 10.0.0.0/8. This rule should be included in one's ruleset: block in quick on igb0 from 10.0.0.0/8 to any","title":"Filtering rules syntax"},{"location":"handbook/network-communications/#address-pools","text":"Address pools group multiple IP addresses/networks into a single reference that can be used in IP Filter rules.","title":"Address pools"},{"location":"handbook/network-communications/#nat-network-address-translation","text":"NAT is used in case when one needs to do address or port translation. This happens when one wants to connect multiple computers at home and share the network connection or when one wants to do port forwarding. NAT on OpenIndiana is set up in /etc/ipf/ipnat.conf and work regarding NATs is done with ipnat(1M) .","title":"NAT (Network Address Translation)"},{"location":"handbook/network-communications/#nat-rules-syntax","text":"To create NAT rules use the following syntax: command interface-name parameters Every rule begins with command from one of these: map - maps one IP address or network to another IP address or network. rdr - redirects packet from one IP address and port to another IP address and port. bimap - creates bidirectorial NAT between an external and an internal IP address. map-block - establishes static IP address-based translation. Interface named is used after command, e.g. igb0 . To determine NAT configuration one has to use one of the following parameters: ipmask - designates the network mask. dstipmask - designates the address ipmask is translated to. mapport - designates TCP or UDP protocols along with range of ports. Assuming we have an external IP address 10.0.0.1/24 on interface eg1000 and an internal range of 192.168.1.0/24. The example NAT rule would look like this: map eg1000 192.168.0.0/24 -> 10.0.0.1/24 NOTE: NAT is not usable with IPv6 IP filter as NAT is deprecated in IPv6. NAT can be only used with IPv4 addresses.","title":"NAT rules syntax"},{"location":"handbook/network-communications/#advanced-networking","text":"< Place holder for content >","title":"Advanced Networking"},{"location":"handbook/network-communications/#crossbow","text":"< Place holder for content >","title":"Crossbow"},{"location":"handbook/network-communications/#hipster-as-a-nas","text":"OpenIndiana provides several ways to share data with network clients.

NOTE: This configuration is not supported by OI nor by Oracle. NOTE: Since GNOME is replaced by Mate in Hipster, installation is a little bit more difficult. For Sun Ray it is still necessary to use GNOME GDM and some other GNOME applications. But it is possible to use also Mate applications like pluma or atril. Limitations: Multihead is possible but the Display Switcher Applet on GNOME-panel on the second screen won't start. So you can't reopen minimized windows on the second screen because these will terminate on minimazing. Install Sun Ray Software still can be downloaded at http://edelivery.oracle.com (registration required). Download the Software for Solaris x86-64 and for Linux x86-64. From the Linux software we take scripts for configure ISC DHCP server described later. Extract the archives. The Solaris packages require Sun DHCP server, which we do not provide anymore. To solve this problem we replace the dependency with isc-dhcp in the IPS packages SUNWutr and SUNWuto with the following script: update_dhcp_dependency #!/bin/ksh # set -x if [ -z $1 ] || [ ! -d $1 ]; then echo \"usage: $0 repodirectory\" exit fi if [[ $1 != /* ]]; then repo=$(pwd)/$1 else repo=$1 fi republish=\"republish$$\" mkdir ${republish} for p in SUNWutr SUNWuto; { (cd ${republish} pkgrecv -d . --raw -s $repo $p || exit 2 for d in $(ls $p); { (cd $p/$d sed -i s#service/network/dhcp#service/network/dhcp/isc-dhcp# manifest pkgrepo -s $repo remove $p pkgsend publish -s $repo -d . manifest ) } ); } rm -r ${republish} Run the script update_dhcp_dependency <extractdirectory>/srs_5.4.5.0-Solaris_11plus.i386/IPS.i386/ to replace the dependcy of package service/network/dhcp by service/network/dhcp/isc-dhcp .

So Sun Ray Server on Hipster has to use DHCP scripts like on Linux. But it is also possible to configure DHCP manually and to skip the utadm step.

How to get GNOME on current Hipster As already mentioned the Sun Ray Software cannot handled by LightDM and we still have to use GDM and some GNOME components necessary for the gnome-greeter session. Be sure you have installed: # pkg install libbonoboui Make sure that they actually install as in the future they may be eventually obsoleted from Hipster (no empty metapackages or obsoleted packages). update older Hipster If you have Sun Ray running on Hipster with GNOME, you can prevent GNOME components removal by \"freezing\" them and releasing their version locks: # pkg freeze gdm libgnomekbd gnome-session gnome-settings-daemon and release the version locks: # pkg change-facet facet.version-lock.gnome/gnome-session=false # pkg change-facet facet.version-lock.gnome/gnome-settings-daemon=false # pkg change-facet facet.version-lock.system/display-manager/gdm=false # pkg change-facet facet.version-lock.library/gnome/libgnomekbd=false NOTE: On IPS there are meta-packages which define package dependencies of type=incorporate , which means: If a package will installed, it have to have the version defined in the incorporate dependency. We want to install an other version of the gnome packages as defined in userland-incorporation meta-package and relaese the version locks like shown above. Install on current Hipster (2022) If you have installed new Hipster, it is necessary to install GNOME packages for GDM and its greeter-session. For user session it is fine to select 'Mate Session', it is no longer necessary to install other packages needed by Gnome Session (only Gnome packages which Mate session still uses). Last known working OpenIndiana GNOME packages versions are the following: gnome-session@2.32.1 gnome-settings-daemon@2.32.1 gdm@2.30.7 libgnomekbd@2.32.0 These are still in hipster repo, but are obsoleted empty metapackages. At http://pkg.toc.de/sunray/ you can find the old GNOME packages with newer release date, so that these should be able to install it on current Hipster. This publisher is provided and supported by community member Carsten Grzemba not by the OpenIndiana project. For this to work add this publisher in a way, that it takes precedence over the default openindiana.org publisher: # pkg set-publisher --search-before=openindiana.org -g http://pkg.toc.de/sunray sunray # pkg set-publisher --non-sticky openindiana.org and install all packages from sunray publisher. NOTE: The version locks of the gnome packages have to relaese like decribed in update older Hipster . Install from Hipster (2019) This is outdated and not necessary anymore. But it is kept here in case someone would still like to run Gnome-Session on Hipster. If you installed new Hipster, it is necessary to install GNOME packages before they were obsoleted from Hipster. Last known working OpenIndiana GNOME packages versions are the following: gnome-desktop@2.32.1 gnome-menus@2.30.5 gnome-panel@2.32.1 gnome-session@2.32.1 gnome-settings-daemon@2.32.1 gdm@2.30.7 metacity@2.30.3 libgnomekbd@2.32.0 libwnck@2.31.0 desktop/screensaver@5.42 XScreenSaver Latest Hipster delivers XScreenSaver only in 64-bit. The SunRay PAM module are shipped as 32-bit only so unlocking works only with 32-bit XScreenSaver. That's why we need the XScreenSaver package with 32-bit bins from http://pkg.toc.de/sunray/ . It is more comfortable to use mate-screensaver. For PAM is only the module mate-screensaver-pam-helper needed. This is not an shared object, instead it is an executable and can be shipped in 32bit independent from the other commands.

Software will periodically have to be updated, redundant software removed, new users added to the system, etc. All these activities and many more are referred to as system administration. Basic system administration can be reduced to a number of common tasks: Users and account management Management of system resources Installation and maintenance of software While it is certainly possible to add more to this list or select alternative items, this small selection is readily absorbed and is convenient to illustrate a number of essential concepts central to OpenIndiana system administration. NOTE: Administrative commands are usually expected to be run with elevated privileges - directly from root user, via sudo(1M) or pfexec (if user was granted privileges via RBAC). In this document commands which require elevated privileges are prefixed with \"# \". Commands, which don't require elevated privileges, are prefixed with \"$ \". Users and account management OpenIndiana allows multiple users to work on the same computer at the same time. Only one person can sit in front of the monitor and keyboard. However, many can be remotely logged into machine and work on it. If a user wants to use the system, he needs an account. There are also special service accounts which are used by system services. User accounts User accounts are primarily used for day-to-day tasks. Every user accessing the system should have his own unique account. This allows the administrator of the system to find out who is doing what. This also allows him to set different access rights for each user separately. When system is installed, usually one user account is created. Additional accounts can be added later. Every user account has some attributes associated with it. username - name of the account, which is typed at the login screen. Username format is briefly described in passwd(4) password - password associated with the account. Accounts without password should not exist on the system as they could put the system at the security risk! UID (user ID) - unique numerical ID of the account in the system. The maximum value for uid is 2147483647. However, for compatibility reasons one should not use numbers over 65535. GID (group ID) - unique numerical ID of the account's primary group. comment (also referred to as gecos) - account description Often this filed is set to real user name. home directory - a path where user will be after he logs into the system. login shell - user's initial shell program. password last change time - time when the password was lastly changed. password aging information - several shadow(4) fields determining when password should be changed min - the minimum number of days required between password changes; max - the maximum number of days the password is valid; warn - the number of days before password expires that the user is warned. Service accounts Service (system) accounts are used by applications, which are running on the system and are providing some services to the network such as DNS, SMTP or WWW. For security reasons these services are ran under non-privileged accounts. OpenIndiana comes with several service accounts such as webservd for web servers, pkg5srv for pkg(5) server or nobody . nobody is a system account for services needing unprivileged user. However, the more services are ran under this account, the more privileged it becomes as it gains access to service processes and files. Roles A role is a basic unit of Role-Based access control (RBAC) or set of privileges one can assume. A role can be thought of as a no-login account. It has most of the attributes of normal user account and is identified like normal user, but is not allowed to log into a system directly. One should login using regular account and use su(1M) to assume the role. Superuser account Every UNIX-like system has the superuser account, named root, used for system administrative tasks. This account has UID 0. Using this account for everyday usage like web browsing, email reading or movie watching is not recommended as root account can operate without any restrictions or limits and could cause serious damage to the system. If you created user during installation, root is created as role (not a regular account). This role is assigned to the user created during the installation. This means that you can't directly log into a system using the root account. One has to log in as the created user and switch to root role using su(1M) . However, if the user was not created during installation, then the root is created as regular account and is able to log in directly. Note, that even when root is created as role, one can use this account directly to log into the system when it's booted in single user mode. SUperuser DO: sudo(1m) It is not always feasible for one user to perform all administrative tasks. It would be more flexible if some tasks could be performed by some, say, experienced users. To enable some users to carry out a command with all root privileges, or to do an administrative command sudo(1M) can be used. The sudo command, i.e., superuser do, permits a regular user to execute the specified set of commands with supperuser privileges without having to become the superuser. If user was permitted to use some commands with superuser privileges via sudo he/she can execute them with elevated privileges simply starting command with sudo . To permit a user to use sudo , the superuser edits /etc/sudoers . This can be done using special visudo(1M) tool. visudo tool edits /etc/sudoers file performing various syntax checks. sudoers(1) provides details on the precise means to appropriately grant user elevated privileges via sudo. Example: To shutdown the system, root privileges are required. If a standard user issues the shutdown command, the system will issue a warning. However, if the user has been enabled to use sudo, then the user can now shutdown the system: $ sudo shutdown -i5 -g0 -y Managing accounts There are several tools in OpenIndiana to manage user accounts. They are listed in the table below. Tool Description useradd(1M) creates new account on the system userdel(1M) deletes account from the system usermod(1M) modifies account information on the system groupadd(1M) creates group on the system groupdel(1M) deletes group from the system groupmod(1M) modifies group information on the system roleadd(1M) creates new role on the system roledel(1M) deletes role from the system rolemod(1M) modifies role information in the system passwd(1) changes login password and password attributes useradd useradd is a program to create user accounts on the system. When creating account one can set some attributes of the newly created account such as comment, group membership, home directory path, UID number of the account or login shell. userdel One can use userdel to remove the account from the system. usermod usermod is used to modify properties of existing account. groupadd groupadd creates a new group definition on the system by adding the appropriate to the /etc/group file. groupdel groupdel deletes a group definition from the system. groupmod When one needs to modify group attributes, groupmod should be used. roleadd roleadd is used create roles in the system. roledel roledel deletes selected role from the system. rolemod rolemod modifies role's information on the system. passwd passwd changes password for user accounts. An unprivileged user may only change the password for his/her own account, while the superuser may change the password for any account. Privileged user can also use paasswd to change login password attributes (such as expiration date) or lock the account. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) The all-or-nothing power assigned to the root user has its obvious limitations. While sudo is an improvement by limiting root privileges for only several commands, more granular control is often desired. An improvement on the above systems would be one in which privileges could be assigned on a more fine-grained and selective basis. Imagine a user assigned the task of administrating some particular hardware, for example, printers attached to the system. A more desirable system would be one in which this user had the ability to permit users to use a printing device, remove print jobs from the print spool or add new printers to the system. Moreover, it would be advantageous if it were possible to assign privileges to perform only these actions and none other. RBAC was developed to accomplish this. What is RBAC How to use RBAC The root user or a user with sudo enabled can shutdown the system. We can use RBAC to enable a user to be able to shutdown the system. However, we can create a role that allows only the privilege to shutdown the system, and no additional privileges. We can then assign this role to one or several users. assign a privilege to a role to shutdown the system # roleadd shutdown Assign a password # passwd shutdown Assign this role to a user # usermod -R shutdown whoever Create a SHUTDOWN profile # echo \"SHUTDOWN:::profile to shutdown:help=shutdown.html\" >> /etc/security/prof_attr Okay, now assign the role profile SHUTDOWN to the role shutdown # rolemod -P SHUTDOWN shutdown Assign some administrative command to profile # echo \"SHUTDOWN:suser:cmd:::/usr/sbin/shutdown:uid=0\" >> /etc/security/exec_attr Use it $ su shutdown # shutdown -i5 -g0 -y Now user whoever can shutdown the system. The pfexec command is more flexible in the number of privileges that can be assigned to a user. Active Directory Integration Introduction There are at least three different possible approaches for Active Directory authentication and each has its pros and cons. Use the new native AD integration with idmap , nss_ad and kclient , this will work with CIFS and NFS out of the box. Use Kerberos and LDAP ( kclient , ldapclient , pam_krb5 and nss_ldap ). Use windbind ( pam_winbind and nss_winbind ). Native AD integration Pro: Fully integrated and native tools only Cons: Doesn't work for UNIX services other than CIFS and NFS. The ephemeral id mapping strategy supposedly wasn't designed for other UNIX services. As a result several problems arrise, one of them is that the mappings aren't constant over the lifetime of UNIX processes which severly breaks UNIX semantics. Depending on your UNIX service you will see unexpected results or even process crashing. In order to use this approach with any UNIX service (eg FTP ) you need to enable directory-based name mapping and install IDMU (Identity Management for UNIX) on the AD server. Refer to the original documentation from Oracle for getting this working: nss_ad , CIFS . Kerberos and LDAP Pro: Fully integrated and native tools only Cons: Requires installation of additional role services (IDMU, Identity Management for UNIX) on the Active Directory side DOC TEAM NOTE: On the Wiki the 'Kerberos and LDAP' page was a separate detailed article on configuration of Windows Server 2008 Active Directory to work with OI. As of 2021, Windows Server 2008 is EoL. This section should not be migrated until it has been checked and updated for recent Windows. Ideally this information should be on a separate page (potentially community contributions) as it\u2019s large and contains a lot of Windows information. winbind Pro: Easy setup, no AD modification Cons: Depends on 3rd party software (Samba), group membership resolution didn't work DOC TEAM NOTE: As above note, the 'winbind' page was a separate detailed article which needs to be checked and updated before it's migrated. Management of System Resources Basic system information System processes $ prstat This command provides a host of information on all processes running on the system. Some of the information provided is as follows: percentage of CPU used by each process amount of memory consumed by each process unique id of each process (which can, for example, be used to stop the process) Disk usage # df -h Provides information on disk size, amount of space used and available free space for all attached storage devices. The -h option reports this information in human readable format. Largest files in a directory Go to the directory using the cd command and issue the following command: $ du | sort -n This will list the size of each file in the current directory and all sub-directories, starting with the smallest up to the largest files. Who is logged on to the system $ listusers List all software packages installed on the system $ pkg list System shutdown, reboot, ... OpenIndiana defines a number of different system states known as run-levels. You can change from one system state to another by using the shutdown command and specify the run-level using the i option. You can always determine the run-level via who -r . You must be root or have root privileges (e.g., using sudo ) to send the system into a different state, i.e., turn off, reboot, etc. Shutdown and turn off all hardware (if supported by the hardware) now: # shutdown -i5 -g0 -y Changing the run-level of the system can be disruptive to other users currently using the system. Thus, it is always wise to establish who is currently logged onto the system before changing the run-level. -i [run-level] is used to specify the run-level. This is either a digit or a single letter. Here are some run-levels available: 5 stop all system services, and turns off hardware devices, etc. 6 reboot the system. 1 single-user mode. Primarily used for system maintenance. S single-user mode where only a command line terminal is available. -g [seconds] is used to specify the number of seconds after which to commence shutting down services. 0 immediately intiates shutting down all services. -y automatically answers all system questions with 'yes'. The shutdown process is not interrupted by system prompts requiring user-interactive intervention. Configuring and Tuning There are a few tools to configure and tune an OpenIndiana system. One of the tools is sysding, a tool that is used by the current OpenIndiana installer to setup static IP addresses when NWAM (automatic network configuration) is not used. For more information on sysding, see the manpage and example config file : # man sysding The configuration file is : /etc/sysding.conf There is also a logfile : /var/log/sysding.log For example a simple /etc/sysding.conf configuration file for a static IP is : setup_interface e1000g0 v4 10.0.2.16 setup_route default 10.0.2.2 This service is meant to be run only once and sets a boolean flag config/finished. In case you want to run sysding again, you'll have to force the finished flag to false : svccfg -s sysding:system setprop config/finished = false refresh Configuring a UPS NUT? Fault management (FMA) < place holder > Virtual Terminals/Consoles (VT) Virtual Terminals/Virtual Consoles (VT) are used to switch between terminals and using system in text mode with Ctrl+Alt+F1,F2..F8 key combinations. NOTE: Switching to VTs using Ctrl+Alt+Fn during current desktop session (at VT7 ) can result in X server and lightdm (or gdm ) restarting and stopping all applications running within it. Currently, there could be problems with getting back to gdm/Xorg session if switching to VTs after gdm restart. Use svcadm restart ligthdm (or svcadm restart gdm ) command again, to have lightdm/gdm Xorg session restarted at VT8 ( Ctrl+Alt+F8 ). At fresh Openindiana install, VT/Consoles are not enabled by default . One needs to set up vtdaemon and console-login:vt2 (till :vt6) and enable vtdaemon options/hotkeys property: pfexec svcadm enable vtdaemon pfexec svcadm enable console-login:vt2 pfexec svcadm enable console-login:vt3 pfexec svcadm enable console-login:vt4 pfexec svcadm enable console-login:vt5 pfexec svcadm enable console-login:vt6 Or do that in a one-liner Bash script: for i in 2 3 4 5 6 ; do pfexec svcadm enable console-login:vt$i; done; Then, enable options/hotkeys property ( Ctrl+Alt+Fn ) to switch VTs and refresh and restart vtdaemon service: pfexec svccfg -s vtdaemon setprop options/hotkeys=true pfexec svcadm refresh vtdaemon pfexec svcadm restart vtdaemon Optionally, you can also disable VT consoles auto screen locking (recommended for personal use, not recommended on server): pfexec svccfg -s vtdaemon setprop options/secure=false The above was inspired by this blog by Danx on Virtual Consoles .

Illumos boot process < place holder > Security < place holder > Zones DOC TEAM NOTE: ITEMS TO WRITE ABOUT: Need to mention some of the changes to zone management...e.g.. sys-unconfig gone. sysding replaced syscfg now have to have DNS, root password, etc. all configured inside the zone before being able to logon using zlogin -C <zonename> , otherwise have to do zlogin <zonename> . So a fair amount of stuff has changed there. Zones are an OpenIndiana feature that provides operating system-level virtualization . Each zone is managed as a completely separate OpenIndiana machine. Zones have very low overhead and are one of the most efficient forms of OS virtualization. The global zone (GZ) is the operating system itself, which has hardware access. From the global zone, non-global zones (NGZ) are created and booted. Boot time for non-global zones is very fast, often a few seconds. The CPU, network, and memory resources for each zone can be controlled from the global zone, ensuring fair access to system resources. Disk space access is usually controlled by ZFS (with quotas and reservations if needed), as well as mounting of filesystem resources with NFS or lofs. As with other forms of virtualization, each zone is isolated from the other zones \u2013 zones cannot see processes or resources used in other zones. The low marginal cost of a zone allows large systems have tens or even hundreds of zones without significant overhead. The theoretical limit to the number of zones on a single platform is 8,192. Different releases of (Open)Solaris used different packaging distribution method for the global zone. OpenIndiana zones use two basic brands - \"ipkg\" and \"nlipkg\", which are based on IPS Packaging. The brand determines how zone is initialized and how zone's processes are treated by kernel. Both type of zones represent a PKG image. \"ipkg\"-branded zones are tightly coupled with GZ. Image pakaging system (IPS) knows about ipkg-branded zones and can perform several actions simultaneously in GZ and NGZ. For example, you can update all your zones and GZ with a single \"pkg update -r\" command. IPS can ensure some depenencies between packages in GZ and NGZ. To allow this it cheks that NGZ's publishers are a superset of GZ's publishers and their properties are the same (for example, stickiness or repository location). As this is not always suitable for development zones, \"nlipkg\"-branded zones were introduced. \"nlipkg\"-branded zone behave like completely independent instance and IPS ignores them during operations in GZ. An easy way to implement zones is to use a separate ZFS file system as the zone root's backing store. File systems are easy to create in ZFS and zones can take advantage of the ZFS snapshot and clone features. Due to the strong isolation between zones, sharing a file system must be done with traditional file sharing methods (eg NFS). When each zone is created it comes with a minimal set of packages, and from there you can add and use most packages and applications as required. Zone networking model OpenIndiana zones can use one of two networking models: a shared IP stack and an exclusive IP stack. There are pros and cons to each of them. Low-level system networking components, such as the ipfilter firewall and the kernel IP routing tables attach to an \"IP stack\", and are thus either unique to a zone or shared by all zones with the one shared stack. There are also some other nuances, such as that the zones with the shared stack can communicate over IP directly, regardless of their subnetting and, to some extent, default firewall packet filtering (that has to be specially configured), while exclusive-IP zones with addresses in different subnets have to communicate over external routers and are subject to common firewall filtering. The global zone defines which physical networks and VLANs the NGZ has access to, and hands down the predefined networking interfaces (the NGZ can not use or create other interfaces). Also, while shared networking allows to configure and attach (or detach) network interfaces from GZ to the NGZ \"on the fly\", changes in exclusive networking require reboot of the zone to propagate device delegation. A zone with an exclusive IP stack can have all the benefits of dedicated hardware networking, including a firewall, access to promiscuous sniffing, routing, configuration of its own IP address (including use of DHCP and static network addressing), etc. This requires a fully dedicated NIC. Usually this is a VNICs - a virtual adapter with own MAC address, that operate as if the VNIC was plugged directly into local LAN in a particular (or default) VLAN. Note also that the local zones with an exclusive IP stack are not subject to the host's shared-stack firewall. Note that if you create zone in VM, the hypervisor can require you to provide some information about its mac addresses. For example, if you configure bridged networking on VirtualBox running on OpenIndiana, you must set secondary-macs property of the VNIC, delegated to VM, to the set of mac addresses of VNICs created inside VMs and enable promiscous mode on VirtualBox network adapter. Quick Setup Example Zone creation consists of two steps - creating zone configuration and zone installation or cloning. Zone configuration determines basic parameters, such as zone's root location and provided resources. Zone configuration is performed using zonecfg tool, zone administration (for example, installation) is performed using zoneadm tool. For example, we create a simple zone with shared networking model: # zonecfg -z example example: No such zone configured Use 'create' to begin configuring a new zone. zonecfg:example> create zonecfg:example> add net zonecfg:example:net> set physical=e1000g0 zonecfg:example:net> set address=192.168.0.10/24 zonecfg:example:net> end zonecfg:example> set zonepath=/zones/example zonecfg:example> verify zonecfg:example> commit zonecfg:example> exit Here create puts you inside the zone configuration program where you can change and update settings particular to the zone specified with -z. zonecfg break different resource groups of data, you add a new resource with add. The next block adds ressource \"net\", configuring network in default shared ip-type mode. It allows zone to share IP stack with GZ. If you want to get dedicated nic in NGZ, you have to use set ip-type=exclusive . In exclusive mode zone has complete control over network interface and you can't assigned address in zonecfg prompt. After network configuration zonepath is set. It's a location for zone's root file system, which should be a ZFS filesystem. The verify command checks that no mistakes were made. Finally changes are committed (saved to zone configuration file). If you want to use dedicated networking for your zone, you should create VNIC and delegate it to the zone. # dladm create-vnic -l e1000g0 vnic0 If you want to specify VLAN id for VNIC, use -v dladm create-vnic option: # dladm create-vnic -l e1000g0 -v 123 vnic0 Now you can create your zone and delegate VNIC to it (note that we set zone's ip-type to exclusive ): # zonecfg -z example example: No such zone configured Use 'create' to begin configuring a new zone. zonecfg:example> create zonecfg:example> set ip-type=exclusive zonecfg:example> add net zonecfg:example:net> set physical=vnic0 zonecfg:example:net> end zonecfg:example> set zonepath=/zones/example zonecfg:example> verify zonecfg:example> commit zonecfg:example> exit After configuring a zone you can install it with zoneadm install subcommand: # zoneadm -z example install During installation pkg image rooted at $zonepath/root is created and minimal set of packages is installed to the image. When installation finishes, zone can be booted with zoneadm -z example boot command. If you want your zone to boot automatically during system startup, you should set autoboot parameter to true during zone configuration: zonecfg:example> set autoboot=true Once zone is booted you can log in locally with zlogin example . If you created zone with dedicated network adapter, you should configure it inside zone. Note, that on first zone boot sysding(1M) will set root's password to NP. Before this happened you will not be able to login to zone with zlogin, so this command will not work on early startup stage. System repository configuration On OpenIndiana it is possible to allow NGZs to access configured publishers via GZ proxy service (so-called zone proxy daemon). This can be useful for sharing pkg cache between zones or to provide network access for performing updates to otherwise restricted zone environment (i.e. to zone without Internet access). The functionality is provided by series of services in GZ and NGZs. In GZ two services are running: system repository service and zones proxy daemon (see pkg.sysrepo(1M) ). In NGZ zones proxy client communicates with GZ's zone proxy daemon. System repository service svc:/application/pkg/system-repository is responsible for providing access to the package repositories configured in a reference image through a centralized proxy. Zones proxy daemon service svc:/application/pkg/zones-proxyd starts on system boot and registers door in each running ipkg-branded zone (the door is created at /var/tmp/zoneproxy_door path). Later, on zone startup or shutdown /usr/lib/zones/zoneproxy-adm is used to notify zones-proxyd, so that it could create the door for the zone or to cleanup it. Zones proxy daemon client svc:/application/pkg/zones-proxy-client:default runs in NGZ and talks to GZ's zones-proxyd via created door. Note, you can't use system repository with nlipkg-branded zones. IPS determines if it should use zones proxy client in zone based on image's use-system-repo property (defaults to False). To configure your system to use system repository, perform the following actions. 1) In global zone: # pkg install pkg:/package/pkg/system-repository pkg:/package/pkg/zones-proxy # svcadm enable svc:/application/pkg/system-repository:default # svcadm enable svc:/application/pkg/zones-proxyd:default 2) In non-global zone: # pkg install pkg:/package/pkg/zones-proxy # svcadm enable svc:/application/pkg/zones-proxy-client:default # pkg set-property use-system-repo True After this in NGZ's publisher description you'll see system-repository location: # pkg publisher PUBLISHER TYPE STATUS P LOCATION openindiana.org (non-sticky, syspub) origin online T <system-repository> hipster-encumbered (syspub) origin online T <system-repository> You can check if your configuration works by issuing pkg refresh command in the zone. pkg(1M) should contact repository indirectly via zones-proxy-client. To revert your zone to proxy-less configuration, run # pkg set-property use-system-repo False Troubleshooting Zone configuration and management operations can fail for a number of reasons, sometimes obscure. This section contains information on how to solve different well-known issues. Fixing zone installation issues Zones on OpenIndiana use ZFS features to manage boot environments. Zone's root and its parent directory should be a ZFS dataset. It's not enough for zone's root (or its parent directory) to be just a directory on ZFS filesystem.

Option Autamatic enables NWAM and configures all interfaces automatically. Network Auto-Magic (NWAM) manages network interfaces as they are dynamically added or removed to or from the system, using network profiles, and is able to change network settings on the fly. NWAM is suitable for servers, laptops, desktops and workstations alike, to automatically configure all wired or wireless network interfaces. Option Manual disables NWAM and creates a /etc/sysding.conf file to setup static IP addresses. Option None can be used to configure networking manually, without NWAM, after installation. Changing from NWAM to Manual Configuration If during install you enabled NWAM, and if you want to disable NWAM you can proceed as follows : # svcadm disable physical:nwam Define your IP/hostname in /etc/hosts . For example: 192.168.1.22 hostname hostname.local localhost loghost # Subsittude 192.168.1.22 for YOUR IP Enable the default physical service with svcadm and configure the interface : # svcadm enable physical:default There are multiple ways to configure the interface : using sysding or directly with ipadm. For more information on sysding, see the section on Configuring and Tuning. To configure an interface with ipadm: # ipadm create-addr -T static -a local=192.168.1.22/24 bge0/v4static or # ipadm create-addr -T dhcp bge0/dhclient The previous example sets up DHCP without using NWAM. NWAM is more than DHCP, because NWAM automatically configures any new interfaces, while the above way to manually setup DHCP is fixed for a specific interface. If you do not know what the interface name is (bge0 in this case); then type in $ dladm show-link or: $ kstat -c net | grep net # look for hme0, bge0, e1000g0 or soemthing that resembles the driver in use. Add gateway # route -p add default 192.168.1.121 or # nano /etc/defaultrouter # Enter in your gateways IP or use the /etc/sysding.conf file to configure a default router and DNS servers. Set DNS server(s) # nano /etc/resolv.conf # Enter in the DNS server IP(s) nameserver 192.168.1.121 or # echo \"nameserver 192.168.1.121\" >> /etc/resolv.conf Restart # reboot NOTE: IF you cannot ping an external IP (e.g. google.com) run this command and try again. # cp /etc/nsswitch.dns /etc/nsswitch.conf credit for this section of the docs go to /u/127b More on Automatic Configuration (NWAM) The following is a more in depth discussion of NWAM, which normally works without any user interaction, but NWAM can be customized using profiles by the user. Using NWAM configuration tools Usually NWAM configuration is done via GUI nwam-manager applet and nwam-manager-properties program. From CLI all configuration can be done using two tools, nwamcfg to configure network profiles and nwamadm to manage them. On its backend, NWAM relies on nwamd , the NWAM policy engine daemon and netcfgd , the NWAM repository daemon. Access to the command line and GUI tools is controlled via security profiles 'Network Autoconf Admin' and 'Network Autoconf user'. To create NWAM profile use nwamcfg tool. # nwamcfg nwamcfg> create ncp Abroad nwamcfg:ncp:Abroad> end Now you can see a new profile in the list of NCPs: nwamcfg> list NCPs: Abroad Automatic Locations: Automatic NoNet User nwamcfg> The network interface to be managed under the new profile can be set and configured with create ncu command: # nwamcfg nwamcfg> select ncp Abroad nwamcfg:ncp:Abroad> create ncu phys e1000g0 Created ncu 'e1000g0'. Walking properties ... activation-mode (manual) [manual|prioritized]> prioritized enabled (true) [true|false]> priority-group> 0 priority-mode [exclusive|shared|all]> exclusive link-mac-addr> link-autopush> link-mtu> nwamcfg:ncp:Abroad:ncu:e1000g0> Most important here is the activation-mode , which states if the profile is to be automatically set based on certain policies or if it is to be manually set using nwamadm. The latter should be most likely the case in a server environment. The priority-group and priority-mode here are set to (0 / exclusive). This says that the profile is for wired access and will always be the only active one at a time. If after listing the changes you are satisfied with the configuration, permanently store it using commit command: nwamcfg:ncp:Abroad:ncu:e1000g0> list ncu:e1000g0 type link class phys parent \"Abroad\" activation-mode prioritized enabled true priority-group 0 priority-mode exclusive nwamcfg:ncp:Abroad:ncu:e1000g0> commit Committed changes nwamcfg:ncp:Abroad:ncu:e1000g0> end After an interface has been assigned to the profile, its IP configuration has to be defined: nwamcfg:ncp:Abroad> create ncu ip e1000g0 Created ncu 'e1000g0'. Walking properties ... enabled (true) [true|false]> ip-version (ipv4,ipv6) [ipv4|ipv6]> ipv4 ipv4-addrsrc (dhcp) [dhcp|static]> static ipv4-addr> 192.168.100.100 ipv4-default-route> 192.168.100.1 nwamcfg:ncp:Abroad:ncu:e1000g0> list ncu:e1000g0 type interface class ip parent \"Abroad\" enabled true ip-version ipv4 ipv4-addrsrc static ipv4-addr \"192.168.100.100\" ipv4-default-route \"192.168.100.1\" ipv6-addrsrc dhcp,autoconf nwamcfg:ncp:Abroad:ncu:e1000g0> As you can see, the profile uses a static IP address and, for simplicity reasons, only provides IPv4 networking. Again, if you're happy with the results, commit them. nwamcfg:ncp:Abroad:ncu:e1000g0> commit Committed changes nwamcfg:ncp:Abroad:ncu:e1000g0> As it stands, now you have defined a pysical and ip layer attached to a network profile: nwamcfg:ncp:Abroad:ncu:e1000g0> end nwamcfg:ncp:Abroad> list NCUs: phys e1000g0 ip e1000g0 nwamcfg:ncp:Abroad>exit To activate the profile, you use nwamadm. First of all, check for the current situation: # nwamadm list TYPE PROFILE STATE ncp Abroad disabled ncp Automatic online ncu:phys e1000g0 online ncu:ip e1000g0 online loc Automatic online loc NoNet offline loc User disabled As you can see, Automatic is the active profile while Abroad is currently disabled. We can change that easily, but be aware that you might lock yourself out if you are connected via SSH when changing the profile! # nwamadm enable -p ncp Abroad Enabling ncp 'Abroad' To check if the change has worked, you can use nwam again, and also ifconfig should show that interface is up: # nwamadm list TYPE PROFILE STATE ncp Abroad online ncu:phys e1000g0 online ncu:ip e1000g0 online ncp Automatic disabled loc Automatic online loc NoNet offline loc User disabled # ifconfig e1000g0 e1000g0: flags=1000843<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST,IPv4> mtu 1500 index 8 inet 192.168.100.100 netmask ffffff00 broadcast 192.168.100.255 ether 0:c:29:56:46:73 If you want to revert to default Automatic ncp, use the following command: # nwamadm enable -p ncp Automatic Although it is possible to directly modify profiles using an editor, it is not advisable and will be hardly necessary, anyway. One of the coolest features of NWAM tools is that they can be completely scripted. All steps above could also be put in one line: # nwamcfg \"create ncp Abroad;create ncu phys e1000g0;set activation-mode=manual;set enabled=true;set priority-group=0;set priority-mode=exclusive;end;create ncu ip e1000g0;set enabled=true;set ip-version=ipv4;set ipv4-addrsrc=static;set ipv4-addr=192.168.100.100;set ipv4-default-route=192.168.100.1;commit\" Or, more nicely formatted, commented and stored in a file: # # Profile for use on the road # # Created on 13/01/2013 by S.

While there is no longer a need to fiddle around in /etc/nwam, the configuration is still completely there, as can be easily verified: # ls /etc/nwam loc loc.conf ncp-Abroad.conf ncp-Automatic.conf All configuration is placed in readable ASCII files so that configuration from a global zone is possible: # cat /etc/nwam/ncp-Abroad.conf link:e1000g0 type=uint64,0;class=uint64,0;parent=string,Abroad;enabled=boolean,true;activation-mode=uint64,4;priority-group=uint64,0;priority-mode=uint64,0; interface:e1000g0 type=uint64,1;class=uint64,1;parent=string,Abroad;enabled=boolean,true;ipv6-addrsrc=uint64,0,1;ip-version=uint64,4;ipv4-addrsrc=uint64,2;ipv4-default-route=string,192.168.100.1;ipv4-addr=string,192.168.100.100; Network automagic online help Comprehensive and fully illustrated online help for using NWAM is available by right clicking the NWAM tray icon and selecting Help . This opens help browser. Troubleshooting NWAM If NWAM is already configured and fails to connect to a wireless network try restarting the service. For example: # svcadm restart nwam Sometimes the location gets set to NoNet and it's nessessary to manually change the location to Automatic . When the location setting is configured to Switch Locations Automatically , it's not possible to change the location. This is resolved by reconfiguring the location to allow manual switching. To perform this task, do the following: Right click the NWAM tray icon and select Location > Switch Locations Manually . Right click the NWAM tray icon and select Location > Automatic .

So a fair amount of stuff has changed there. Zones are an OpenIndiana feature that provides operating system-level virtualization . Each zone is managed as a completely separate OpenIndiana machine. Zones have very low overhead and are one of the most efficient forms of OS virtualization. The global zone (GZ) is the operating system itself, which has hardware access. From the global zone, non-global zones (NGZ) are created and booted. Boot time for non-global zones is very fast, often a few seconds. The CPU, network, and memory resources for each zone can be controlled from the global zone, ensuring fair access to system resources. Disk space access is usually controlled by ZFS (with quotas and reservations if needed), as well as mounting of filesystem resources with NFS or lofs. As with other forms of virtualization, each zone is isolated from the other zones \u2013 zones cannot see processes or resources used in other zones. The low marginal cost of a zone allows large systems have tens or even hundreds of zones without significant overhead. The theoretical limit to the number of zones on a single platform is 8,192. Different releases of (Open)Solaris used different packaging distribution method for the global zone. OpenIndiana zones use two basic brands - \"ipkg\" and \"nlipkg\", which are based on IPS Packaging. The brand determines how zone is initialized and how zone's processes are treated by kernel. Both type of zones represent a PKG image. \"ipkg\"-branded zones are tightly coupled with GZ. Image pakaging system (IPS) knows about ipkg-branded zones and can perform several actions simultaneously in GZ and NGZ. For example, you can update all your zones and GZ with a single \"pkg update -r\" command. IPS can ensure some depenencies between packages in GZ and NGZ. To allow this it cheks that NGZ's publishers are a superset of GZ's publishers and their properties are the same (for example, stickiness or repository location). As this is not always suitable for development zones, \"nlipkg\"-branded zones were introduced. \"nlipkg\"-branded zone behave like completely independent instance and IPS ignores them during operations in GZ. An easy way to implement zones is to use a separate ZFS file system as the zone root's backing store. File systems are easy to create in ZFS and zones can take advantage of the ZFS snapshot and clone features. Due to the strong isolation between zones, sharing a file system must be done with traditional file sharing methods (eg NFS). When each zone is created it comes with a minimal set of packages, and from there you can add and use most packages and applications as required.","title":"Zones"},{"location":"handbook/systems-administration/#zone-networking-model","text":"OpenIndiana zones can use one of two networking models: a shared IP stack and an exclusive IP stack. There are pros and cons to each of them. Low-level system networking components, such as the ipfilter firewall and the kernel IP routing tables attach to an \"IP stack\", and are thus either unique to a zone or shared by all zones with the one shared stack. There are also some other nuances, such as that the zones with the shared stack can communicate over IP directly, regardless of their subnetting and, to some extent, default firewall packet filtering (that has to be specially configured), while exclusive-IP zones with addresses in different subnets have to communicate over external routers and are subject to common firewall filtering. The global zone defines which physical networks and VLANs the NGZ has access to, and hands down the predefined networking interfaces (the NGZ can not use or create other interfaces). Also, while shared networking allows to configure and attach (or detach) network interfaces from GZ to the NGZ \"on the fly\", changes in exclusive networking require reboot of the zone to propagate device delegation. A zone with an exclusive IP stack can have all the benefits of dedicated hardware networking, including a firewall, access to promiscuous sniffing, routing, configuration of its own IP address (including use of DHCP and static network addressing), etc. This requires a fully dedicated NIC. Usually this is a VNICs - a virtual adapter with own MAC address, that operate as if the VNIC was plugged directly into local LAN in a particular (or default) VLAN. Note also that the local zones with an exclusive IP stack are not subject to the host's shared-stack firewall. Note that if you create zone in VM, the hypervisor can require you to provide some information about its mac addresses. For example, if you configure bridged networking on VirtualBox running on OpenIndiana, you must set secondary-macs property of the VNIC, delegated to VM, to the set of mac addresses of VNICs created inside VMs and enable promiscous mode on VirtualBox network adapter.","title":"Zone networking model"},{"location":"handbook/systems-administration/#quick-setup-example","text":"Zone creation consists of two steps - creating zone configuration and zone installation or cloning. Zone configuration determines basic parameters, such as zone's root location and provided resources. Zone configuration is performed using zonecfg tool, zone administration (for example, installation) is performed using zoneadm tool. For example, we create a simple zone with shared networking model: # zonecfg -z example example: No such zone configured Use 'create' to begin configuring a new zone. zonecfg:example> create zonecfg:example> add net zonecfg:example:net> set physical=e1000g0 zonecfg:example:net> set address=192.168.0.10/24 zonecfg:example:net> end zonecfg:example> set zonepath=/zones/example zonecfg:example> verify zonecfg:example> commit zonecfg:example> exit Here create puts you inside the zone configuration program where you can change and update settings particular to the zone specified with -z. zonecfg break different resource groups of data, you add a new resource with add. The next block adds ressource \"net\", configuring network in default shared ip-type mode. It allows zone to share IP stack with GZ. If you want to get dedicated nic in NGZ, you have to use set ip-type=exclusive . In exclusive mode zone has complete control over network interface and you can't assigned address in zonecfg prompt. After network configuration zonepath is set. It's a location for zone's root file system, which should be a ZFS filesystem. The verify command checks that no mistakes were made. Finally changes are committed (saved to zone configuration file). If you want to use dedicated networking for your zone, you should create VNIC and delegate it to the zone. # dladm create-vnic -l e1000g0 vnic0 If you want to specify VLAN id for VNIC, use -v dladm create-vnic option: # dladm create-vnic -l e1000g0 -v 123 vnic0 Now you can create your zone and delegate VNIC to it (note that we set zone's ip-type to exclusive ): # zonecfg -z example example: No such zone configured Use 'create' to begin configuring a new zone. zonecfg:example> create zonecfg:example> set ip-type=exclusive zonecfg:example> add net zonecfg:example:net> set physical=vnic0 zonecfg:example:net> end zonecfg:example> set zonepath=/zones/example zonecfg:example> verify zonecfg:example> commit zonecfg:example> exit After configuring a zone you can install it with zoneadm install subcommand: # zoneadm -z example install During installation pkg image rooted at $zonepath/root is created and minimal set of packages is installed to the image. When installation finishes, zone can be booted with zoneadm -z example boot command. If you want your zone to boot automatically during system startup, you should set autoboot parameter to true during zone configuration: zonecfg:example> set autoboot=true Once zone is booted you can log in locally with zlogin example . If you created zone with dedicated network adapter, you should configure it inside zone. Note, that on first zone boot sysding(1M) will set root's password to NP. Before this happened you will not be able to login to zone with zlogin, so this command will not work on early startup stage.","title":"Quick Setup Example"},{"location":"handbook/systems-administration/#system-repository-configuration","text":"On OpenIndiana it is possible to allow NGZs to access configured publishers via GZ proxy service (so-called zone proxy daemon). This can be useful for sharing pkg cache between zones or to provide network access for performing updates to otherwise restricted zone environment (i.e. to zone without Internet access). The functionality is provided by series of services in GZ and NGZs. In GZ two services are running: system repository service and zones proxy daemon (see pkg.sysrepo(1M) ). In NGZ zones proxy client communicates with GZ's zone proxy daemon. System repository service svc:/application/pkg/system-repository is responsible for providing access to the package repositories configured in a reference image through a centralized proxy. Zones proxy daemon service svc:/application/pkg/zones-proxyd starts on system boot and registers door in each running ipkg-branded zone (the door is created at /var/tmp/zoneproxy_door path). Later, on zone startup or shutdown /usr/lib/zones/zoneproxy-adm is used to notify zones-proxyd, so that it could create the door for the zone or to cleanup it. Zones proxy daemon client svc:/application/pkg/zones-proxy-client:default runs in NGZ and talks to GZ's zones-proxyd via created door. Note, you can't use system repository with nlipkg-branded zones. IPS determines if it should use zones proxy client in zone based on image's use-system-repo property (defaults to False). To configure your system to use system repository, perform the following actions. 1) In global zone: # pkg install pkg:/package/pkg/system-repository pkg:/package/pkg/zones-proxy # svcadm enable svc:/application/pkg/system-repository:default # svcadm enable svc:/application/pkg/zones-proxyd:default 2) In non-global zone: # pkg install pkg:/package/pkg/zones-proxy # svcadm enable svc:/application/pkg/zones-proxy-client:default # pkg set-property use-system-repo True After this in NGZ's publisher description you'll see system-repository location: # pkg publisher PUBLISHER TYPE STATUS P LOCATION openindiana.org (non-sticky, syspub) origin online T <system-repository> hipster-encumbered (syspub) origin online T <system-repository> You can check if your configuration works by issuing pkg refresh command in the zone. pkg(1M) should contact repository indirectly via zones-proxy-client.

NOTE: This configuration is not supported by OI nor by Oracle. SamFS versus QFS It seems like this product contains two different filesystems. QFS (quick file system) can be shared between multiple hosts, if you use shared storge like it is possible in FC-SAN. For QFS you need two different kinds of block storage, one for metadata and one for the file data. If you configure the archive service then QFS becomes SamFS. Archive service means here, the filesystem content can automatically create up to 4 copies on different storage devices. The archiving is controlled by policies. The archive storage can be inexpensive disk storage, NFS-Share or tape storage. Nowadays tape storage is managed by generic SCSI libraries. So policy based storage tiering is applied. The benefit of this product is that the archive service stores the copies on archive storage in ordinary TAR files. For instance you lost your SamFS asset and are left with only the tape media, data can simply be restored with the Unix tar command. If the filesystem becomes full the data blocks of a file can be released and the file turns to offline. So the limit of the SamFS file system is determined by the space for the metadata in the metadata device. SamFS is a good solution, if you: have a lot of rarely used data you wish to have backup copies of your data, best on tape prefer to secure your data by WORM Notes about this release This version is updated in relation to the original version released by Sun Microsystems 2009: current OHSM dumps can be restored, NFSv4 ACL's or LTFS information will be ignored LTO-5 -- LTO-8 tape drives added and tested samst driver replaced by sgen Sun Support framework removed the Web based managment tool, part of the Sun webconsole was never tested, however the libsammgmt based tools like samcrondump are still working. Install SamQFS can simply installed by: # pkg install samqfs This will install the entire software, add the filesystem driver samfs , two additional pseudo device drivers samioc and samaio as well as two SMF services: online Feb_08 svc:/system/samqfs-postinstall:default online Feb_08 svc:/system/sam-fsd:default Keep in mind that the service 'sam-fsd' only needs to enabled temporarily. The system/samqfs-postinstall SMF will setup the /etc/opt/SUNWsamfs directory from template files. All the configuration files of Storage Archive Manager reside within this directory. The local state files are in /var/opt/SUNWsamfs . A small home server setup Let's assume you have a home server running OpenIndiana Hipster. The internal disks are configured in a Zpool. You want to have backup copies of your data so that you are prepared in the case of damaged or lost data. SamFS file system Configure two Zvols, one Zvol rpool/samfsmm for metadata e.g. 10g size and one Zvol rpool/samfsmr for the file content e.g. 1TB. Configure the SamFS file system in the /etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/mcf (main configuration file) as follows: # # Sun StorEdge SAM-FS file system configuration example # # Equipment Eq Eq Family Dev Additional # Identifier Nm Tp Set St Parameters # --------------- -- -- ------ --- ---------- samfs1 10 ma samfs1 /dev/zvol/dsk/rpool/samfsmm 11 mm samfs1 - /dev/zvol/dsk/rpool/samfsmr 12 mr samfs1 - run # sam-fsd and check output for errors and then # sammkfs samfs1 then you can mount the SamFS file system # mount -T samfs samfs1 /archive It is suggested to add the following to /etc/vfstab . samfs1 - /sam1 samfs - no - Archive Storage The copies should be stored on external USB-drives. Hence we connect two USB-drives and create two Zpools usbdisk1 and usbdisk2 on them. For the archive service create the config file /etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/diskvols.conf # # diskvols.conf # # VSN Name [Host Name:]Path # usbdisk01 /usbdisk1/samarch usbdisk02 /usbdisk2/samarch On the Zpools two ZFS datasets usbdisk[12]/samarch are created. Archive Rule Now we determine the archive policies in the config file /etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/archiver.cmd . # # Global Directives # # logfile = /var/opt/SUNWsamfs/logs/archiver.log # # # File System Directives # fs = samfs1 1 4m -norelease 2 16m # # VSN Directives # vsns samfs1.1 dk usbdisk01 samfs1.2 dk usbdisk02 endvsns We define to create 2 copies of your data files on /archive , after 4 minutes write the first copy on usbdisk1 , the second after 16m on usbdisk02 . The file should stay online on the filesystem until the second copy is made. check the configuration # sam-fsd ... # archiver -lv ... activate the configuration # samd config # pkill -HUP sam-fsd A VTL setup For use of a SCSI Tape Library we have to configure sgen for use with an autochanger run the following: update_drv -a -i '\"scsiclass,08\"' sgen If no physical tape library is available, the Quadstor VTL is a simple alternative. https://www.quadstor.com/ The VTL will connected via ISCSI.

The RPC service is started for remote controlling the SamFS. SamFS usage A SamFS filesystem can never be become full as long as the archive storage is not full. Because the SamFS is a hierachical filesystem it can release data blocks of files which not needed in the moment. On SamFS such file is called 'offline'. If an attempt is made to open a file which is offline the stager will copy the data blocks back from archive storage. File versioning If you change a file the archive service will automatically create new archive copies. It is recommended to save the metadata of the filesystem (inodes) for situations where you have to recover the SamFS filesystem. With assistance of such metadata dumps you are able to recover older versions of the files also. SamFS administration Too much CLI for you? There is a more comfortable terminal tool available: /opt/SUNWsamfs/sbin/samu . These are some of common CLI tools for filesystems. However in SamFS the prefix 's' is added. Unix command SamFS command notes ls sls most commonly user with option -D find sfind extended to manage finding archive copies du sdu shows real filesystem usage tar star handles SamFS archives Detailed explanation of all commands as well as configuration examples can be found in the manual pages.

QFS (quick file system) can be shared between multiple hosts, if you use shared storge like it is possible in FC-SAN. For QFS you need two different kinds of block storage, one for metadata and one for the file data. If you configure the archive service then QFS becomes SamFS. Archive service means here, the filesystem content can automatically create up to 4 copies on different storage devices. The archiving is controlled by policies. The archive storage can be inexpensive disk storage, NFS-Share or tape storage. Nowadays tape storage is managed by generic SCSI libraries. So policy based storage tiering is applied. The benefit of this product is that the archive service stores the copies on archive storage in ordinary TAR files. For instance you lost your SamFS asset and are left with only the tape media, data can simply be restored with the Unix tar command. If the filesystem becomes full the data blocks of a file can be released and the file turns to offline. So the limit of the SamFS file system is determined by the space for the metadata in the metadata device.

Vagrant forwards the X11 DISPLAY over SSH so that it is possible to forward the Squeak display in an OpenIndiana guest to a Linux host, for example. Squeak consists of a VM (virtual machine) and Smalltalk images. You can find Smalltalk images at files.squeak.org or at cuis-smalltalk.org . Cuis and Squeak both use the Squeak VM, but they offer different Smalltalk images. The Squeak images have traditional MVC (Model, View, Controller) and Morphic graphical user interface classes. Cuis has Morphic-3, which is an enhanced set of Morphic classes. See the Squeak website for more and general information on Squeak, specifically the documentation section. See cuis-smalltalk.org for more info Cuis. Also see the Squeak Wiki : Squeak Wiki Classic VM and OpenSmalltalk VM There are currently three Squeak packages for OpenIndiana : squeak, stack-spur and cog-spur. Their package names begin with pkg:/runtime/smalltalk. These packages can be installed simultaneously mediated by the squeak mediator (see below). # pkg list | grep smalltalk runtime/smalltalk/squeak 4.19.6-2020.0.1.4 i-- runtime/smalltalk/squeak-display-X11 4.19.6-2020.0.1.4 i-- runtime/smalltalk/squeak-nodisplay 4.19.6-2020.0.1.4 i-- runtime/smalltalk/cog-spur 5.0.2957-2020.0.1.0 i-- runtime/smalltalk/cog-spur-display-X11 5.0.2957-2020.0.1.0 i-- runtime/smalltalk/cog-spur-nodisplay 5.0.2957-2020.0.1.0 i-- The basic squeak package corresponds to the classical virtual machine (VM). The stack-spur and cog-spur packages are OpenSmalltalk based virtual machines, where stack-spur is the OpenSmalltalk stack VM, using the Spur memory management, and cog-spur is the OpenSmalltalk cog VM, also using the Spur memory management; the cog VM is a just-in-time compiler (JIT) which is a faster implementation of Squeak. A first screenshot illustrates squeak, version 4.19.6, running on OpenIndiana, with an old style MVC (Model, View, Controller) look and feel : The following screenshot illustrates squeak, version 4.19.3, with the (default) Morphic user interface, running on OpenIndiana, playing bachFugue through pulseaudio, and with a classical Smalltalk bouncing atoms animation : Squeak has a Test Runner.

The Squeak VM for OpenIndiana has a SVGPluginEngine for fast rendering and manipulation of Scalable Vector Graphics : OpenIndiana Prerequisites Before installing, the OpenIndiana system should have some required packages installed. To check the required dependencies for Squeak, use the command: # pkg contents -r -t depend squeak or # pkg contents -r -t depend stack-spur or # pkg contents -r -t depend cog-spur This will list a number of dependencies. If those are not met, you should upgrade OpenIndiana before attempting to install Squeak. You can upgrade OpenIndiana and check the dependencies again: # pkg update -v Squeak is in the OpenIndiana userland-incorporation package since version 0.5.11-2020.0.1.13018. Use the following command to check the installed consolidation: # pkg list userland-incorporation The installed version should be more recent than 0.5.11-2020.0.1.13018. Squeak for OpenIndiana provides a vm-display-X11 plugin for using the X11 window system. By setting the X11 DISPLAY variable or by using X11 forwarding over SSH, it is possible to run Squeak remotely and forward the display to another machine. It is also possible to run Squeak without display, or headlessly. Installing squeak, the classic VM On OpenIndiana install squeak as follows: # pkg install -v squeak After installation, see the squeak(1) manpage for documentation: # man squeak After installation you can verify the installation as follows: # pkg list squeak # pkg list squeak-nodisplay # pkg list squeak-display-X11 The squeak-nodisplay package is for running squeak with the -nodisplay option, headless, without display. The squeak-display-X11 adds the necessary plugins for running X11, but still without all plugins. squeak depends on squeak-nodisplayand squeak-display-X11 and it installs all plugins. During installation you may also notice: Changed mediators: mediator squeak: version: None -> 4 (system default) The OpenIndiana mediator squeak selects which version of Squeak to use: squeak or one of the stack-spur or cog-spur. There is a utility included to start using Squeak : # inisqueak This is equivalent to downloading the Smalltalk sources and image from the Squeak website: # unzip SqueakV46.sources.zip and # unzip Squeak4.6-15102.zip You would then launch Squeak as follows (also see the manpage for further details) : # squeak Squeak4.6-15102.image Installing the OpenSmalltalk VM It is possible to simultaneously install squeak and opensmalltalk as follows: # pkg install -v stack-spur At the end of installation the hardlink squeak will point to the stack-spur binary. You will notice that the mediator changed to version 5. # pkg mediator squeak The system-administrator can override the OpenIndiana choice by using the pkg set-mediator or pkg unset-mediator commands. After installation of opensmalltalk, it is possible again to use inisqueak : # inisqueak This is equivalent to downloading sources and Smalltalk images from the Squeak website : # unzip SqueakV50.sources.zip and # unzip Squeak5.3-19431-64bit.zip You would then launch squeak as follows: # squeak Squeak5.3-19431-64bit.image Squeak V5 can also run Cuis images. See the Cuis website for more details. Given the CuisV5.sources and Cuis5.0-4112.image : # squeak Cuis5.0-4112.image Because both packages can be installed simultaneously it is possible to run side-by-side Squeak 4.6 and Squeak 5.3, Cuis Smalltalk or Squeak 6.0 alpha images. There is an additional package cog-spur which is the Cog implementation of Squeak. This is a faster implementation of the Squeak virtual machine. It can be installed as follows: # pkg install -v cog-spur During installation of the cog implementation, the mediator will be changed as follows: Changed mediators: mediator squeak: version: None -> 5 (system default) implementation: None -> cog-spur (system default) The stack-spur and cog-spur packages can be installed at the same time, and the system administrator can choose the implementation with the pkg unset-mediator and set-mediator commands. Modifying the policy.conf file for OpenSmalltalk The following notes do not apply to classic squeak, they only apply to OpenSmalltalk. The OpenSmalltalk VM stack-spur or cog-spur will print the following error: # pthread_setschedparam failed: Not owner This is due to a lack of \"proc_priocntl\" privilege. # ppriv -v -l proc_priocntl This privilege allows a process to elevate its priority above its current level. It allows a process to change its scheduling class to any scheduling class, including the RT class. You can change the following in the /etc/security/policy.conf: # cp /etc/security/policy.conf /etc/security/policy.conf.orig change #PRIV_DEFAULT=basic to PRIV_DEFAULT=basic,proc_priocntl You can run squeak in a zone and do the above in a zone only. If you run squeak in a zone, you may also have to set the privilege limit: # zonecfg -z example-zone info | grep limitpriv limitpriv: default,proc_priocntl Updating Squeak The complete OpenIndiana system can be updated with: # pkg update to update the entire userland-incorporation. If there is a need to install a different version of squeak, without upgrading the userland-incorporation, you can do : # pkg change-facet facet.version-lock.runtime/stack-spur=false and # pkg change-facet facet.version-lock.runtime/stack-spur-nodisplay=false This can make it possible to update stack-spur without updating the userland-incorporation: # pkg list userland-incorporation and then update stack-spur or any other squeak package separately: # pkg update stack-spur Uninstalling Squeak To uninstall squeak, the command is : # pkg uninstall squeak squeak-nodisplay squeak-display-X11 For opensmalltalk : # pkg uninstall cog-spur cog-spur-nodisplay cog-spur-display-X11 Note that the nodisplay package is not necessarily uninstalled by uninstalling squeak or cog-spur.","title":"Squeak Smalltalk-80 Installation"},{"location":"handbook/community/squeak/#hipster-handbook-squeak-cuis-and-smalltalk-80","text":"The following notes document the steps to install Squeak and Cuis on OpenIndiana Hipster, and how to use these implementations of Smalltalk-80.

Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow. See vagrantup.com or hashicorp.com for more information. The following notes explain how to build vagrant from source for OpenIndiana and how to use vagrant with VirtualBox as provider. Installing Ruby from source Vagrant uses some tools such as git, curl, bsdtar and Ruby. Although that Ruby is available in the OpenIndiana repositories, Hashicorp recommends NOT to use the system provided Ruby. So we'll build Ruby from source as well. Complete instructions from Hashicorp are available at : https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/source Create a ZFS filesystem (or just a directory) to install Ruby and Vagrant : # zfs create -o mountpoint=/scratch rpool/scratch Make a non-root user the owner of that directory. This is the user that you normally use to login into your OI system : # chown <some-user> /scratch Install the OpenIndiana development tools if you do not already have them : # pkg install build-essential You can use gcc 7.5 to build a 32bit executable, or use gcc 10.3 to build a 64bit ruby executable : # pkg install gcc-10 # pkg set-mediator -V 10 gcc # pkg mediator gcc MEDIATOR VER. SRC. VERSION IMPL. SRC. IMPLEMENTATION gcc local 10 system Check that automake and autoconf are installed : # pkg install developer/build/autoconf # pkg install developer/build/automake Then as ordinary non-root user continue. As non-root user, you can now either build ruby from the git repo, or you can download a .tar.gz ruby source package. If you clone the git repo, then do : $ cd /scratch $ git clone https://github.com/ruby/ruby.git $ cd ruby $ git checkout ruby_3_0 $ ./autogen.sh The above commands set up the source tree using the autogen.sh script and checkout the 3.0 branch of ruby. On the other hand, if you download Ruby version 3.0.2 (or 3.0.3 when it will be released) from : https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ then copy ruby-3.0.2.tar.gz to the scratch directory and extract it there : $ cd /scratch $ gtar xvfz ruby-3.0.2.tar.gz In this case, make sure that the bison grammar ripper.y is NOT rebuilt on OI. This is minor issue currently at time of writing these notes with bison. The Ruby sources are generated with bison 3.5.1 while OI currently runs a more recent version of bison (3.8.2) : $ ls -l ruby-3.0.2/ext/ripper/ripper.* $ touch ruby-3.0.2/ext/ripper/ripper.c You can verify that the grammar in the ruby source package is built using an older version of bison. The touch command attempts to avoid a rebuild. $ head ruby-3.0.2/ext/ripper/ripper.y $ ls -l ruby-3.0.2/ext/ripper/ripper.* Then cd into the source directory of the downloaded source package : $ cd ruby-3.0.2 Whether you have cloned the git repo, or downloaded the source package, continue now to configure Ruby 3.0.2 : A first option is to build ruby with O3 and g3 optimisation and without DTrace : $ ./configure --disable-dtrace --with-gcc --prefix=/scratch/ruby-30 A second option, is to enable DTrace and build with O3 and g1 optimisation : $ ./configure --enable-dtrace --with-gcc --prefix=/scratch/ruby-30 debugflags=\"-g1\" Note in the above, if you enable DTrace, that the debugflags is set to -g1 (level g1). Currently there is a problem with the DTrace build and g3 level debug information, while with level 1 debug info, the build with DTrace enabled, works. Either way, whether you have configured Ruby 3.0.2 with or without DTrace, install it under /scratch/ruby-30 as follows : $ gmake install Modify the PATH to use Ruby 3.0.2 : $ PATH=/scratch/ruby-30/bin:$PATH $ ruby --version ruby 3.0.3p150 (2021-11-06 revision 6d540c1b98) [i386-solaris2.11] The ruby 3.0.3p150 string is from the git repo using the not-yet released ruby 3.0.3. But the same procedure applies to ruby 2.7.4, 3.0.2 or even ruby 3.1. If you used gcc 10.3 for the build, you should see x64_64 instead of i386 because then you should have built a 64bit ruby instead. Installing Vagrant from source Complete instructions from Hashicorp are available at : https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/source Create a vagrant directory as ordinary non-root user (same login user as used for the installation of Ruby 3.0.2) : $ mkdir /scratch/vagrant Git clone the Vagrant source code : $ cd /scratch/vagrant $ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant.git . Make sure that bundle and bundler commands are from Ruby 3.0.2 : $ type bundler bundler is a tracked alias for /scratch/ruby-30/bin/bundler ls /scratch/ruby-30/bin/ bundle htmldiff listen rdoc rwinrm bundler httpclient racc ri rwinrmcp erb irb rake rspec thor gem ldiff rbs ruby typeprof Follow the Hashicorp instructions for the install by running : $ bundle install The above is a non-root installation into /scratch/ruby-30. Then create a binstub and add it to your path : $ bundle --binstubs exec $ PATH=/scratch/vagrant/exec:$PATH Note that the above adds the directory exec, not bin, to the PATH. There also is a bin directory but that's not the binstub directory. $ type vagrant vagrant is a tracked alias for /scratch/vagrant/exec/vagrant $ vagrant --version Vagrant 2.2.20.dev VirtualBox Vagrant can use multiple providers, but in this case we use VirtualBox as provider: # pkg list virtualbox NAME (PUBLISHER) VERSION IFO system/virtualbox 6.1.30-2021.0.0.0 i-- Vagrant uses a Vagrantfile to describe the actions to build the virtual machine or machines. Once you or someone else creates a single Vagrantfile, you just need to vagrant up and everything is installed and configured for you to work. If the Vagrantfile uses internal networks, check first that internal networks are defined in VirtualBox under the File menu (Host Network Manager). The following example shows a setup with two internal networks. By default there will only be just one internal network : # dladm show-phys | grep vbox vboxnet0 Ethernet up 1000 full vboxnet0 vboxnet1 Ethernet up 1000 full vboxnet1 On VirtualBox 6.1.30 it also seems necessary to set up a file in /etc/vbox : $ cat /etc/vbox/networks.conf * 192.168.56.0/16 192.168.99.0/16 With the VBoxManage command, check the available internal networks: $ VBoxManage list hostonlyifs | grep 192 IPAddress: 192.168.56.1 IPAddress: 192.168.99.1 The above example is for 2 internal networks. By default only the 192.168.56.1 is setup by the default VirtualBox installation. Testing Vagrant projects from Oracle Many Vagrantfile are provided, for example some are by Oracle, for testing products such as the Oracle Database. As ordinary login user do: $ mkdir -p /scratch/oracle/vagrant-projects Then clone the Oracle vagrant projects : $ cd /scratch/oracle/vagrant-projects $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/vagrant-projects.git .

Many other Vagrantfiles exist in the cloud. Vagrant and Pulseaudio A Vagrant VM can set the PULSE_SERVER environment variable and play sounds or music on the host, if the host is set up to accept remote connections. This is similar to X11 forwarding over SSH : X11 can also be forwarded from a Vagrant VM to the host. On platforms with the paprefs executable, this can be configured using paprefs : If the paprefs command is not available, pulseaudio can be reconfigured with : dconf load /org/freedesktop/pulseaudio/module-groups/ <<EOF [remote-access] args0='' args1='' enabled=true name0='module-native-protocol-tcp' name1='module-esound-protocol-tcp' EOF Check using the pax11publish or pactl info commands that pulseaudio accepts remote connections : $ pax11publish Server: {f6f2af56ea9e3944e926c6b946197a34b}unix:/tmp/pulse-K2hFZViPE4v5/native tcp:somehost:4713 tcp6:somehost:4713 On the host or in the Vagrant VM the pactl info command can be used to test the connection to the pulse server that is running on the host : $ pactl info Server String: tcp:localhost:24713 Library Protocol Version: 33 Server Protocol Version: 33 Is Local: no ...

OpenIndiana Vagrantfiles See https://app.vagrantup.com/openindiana/boxes/hipster . The oi-userland repository has for example also a Vagrantfile that can be used to create a VM to host oi-userland (by Adam Stevko and Michal Nowak).

OpenIndiana is an advanced enterprise OS from the Sun branch of the Unix-like family tree, and as such it can sometimes seem quite complex ( Spending several decades running important servers can do that to an OS! ). But with a little help and information, once you know the basics, you'll find it actually has some of the nicest and friendliest tools around. As with most Unix-like operating systems it can be completely controlled via a Command Line Interface shell, but it also supports a windowing GUI system. From the CLI, it supports a number of different shells, the two main ones being ksh93 and Bash. It also supports the original SunOS SVR4 commands, Like the command and syntax familiar to BSD users, and a large portion of the GNU userland commands that most Linux users are familiar with. You can select any or all of those different commands from your shell configuration, giving you the environment you are most happy with. By default, the windowing GUI system is based on the popular Mate system. OpenIndiana also has a powerful package manager, IPS, for updating and installing new software. Although powerful, it may seem complicated at first; but, help is provided in these pages. OpenIndiana supports a wide range of popular software, including the main open source Internet server software, databases, Internet client software, development languages and tools and more. The Popular Software provides some links and notes about some of the community favorites, but many more are supported. In addition to the Hipster IPS repositories, OpenIndiana can also use the SFE and pkgsrc package repositories which provide additional software options. What is OpenIndiana Project? The OpenIndiana project is the open source community which develops, maintains, and supports the OpenIndiana distribution, an Illumos based Unix-like operating system derived from OpenSolaris. The purpose of the OpenIndiana Project is to ensure the continued availability of an openly developed distribution based on OpenSolaris. The OpenIndiana project is also a continuation of the collaborative effort and community spirit of the OpenSolaris project . For a comprehensive history of the OpenSolaris project, see Jim Grisanzio's OpenSolaris timeline . Why is it called OpenIndiana? OpenIndiana obtains its name from Project Indiana, an open source effort by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation) to produce OpenSolaris, a community developed Unix-like distribution based on Sun Solaris. Project Indiana was led by Ian Murdock, founder of the Debian Linux Distribution. How are OpenIndiana and Illumos related? The Illumos project is the open source community which develops, maintains, and supports illumos-gate , the core software used by the OpenIndiana distribution. Similar to a BSD src tree, illumos-gate includes the illumos kernel, along with many of the device drivers, core libraries, and system utilities. To form a complete distribution, the OpenIndiana project combines illumos-gate with oi-userland , and with other free and open-source software. This melding of software from many different open-source projects is similar to how Linux distributions use the Linux kernel along with software from the GNU and various other open source projects. How does OpenIndiana differ from OpenSolaris? Some of the differences between OpenIndiana and OpenSolaris can be characterized as follows: Sun's OS/NET consolidation (closed by Oracle) has been replaced with illumos-gate . Many of the original OpenSolaris software consolidations have been reorganized into a single oi-userland consolidation. Oracle's Sun Studio has been replaced with the open source GNU GCC compiler. XVM (XEN) has been replaced with the illumos-kvm port. NOTE: OpenIndiana Hipster's transition from Sun Studio to GCC has resulted in a discontinuance of C++ ABI compatibility with previous releases of OpenIndiana, Oracle Solaris, and OpenSolaris. How does OpenIndiana compare to BSD or Linux? All of these operating systems follow the Unix paradigm and contain tools and commands which bear a similar resemblance, although specific feature sets and command usage may be dissimilar. If you are coming to OpenIndiana from either BSD or Linux, you will quickly learn these differences. In no time at all, you'll feel right at home working with OpenIndiana's tools and commands. What features does OpenIndiana have? OpenIndiana contains the following enterprise class features and more: Feature Description ZFS ZFS File System and Volume Manager DTrace Dynamic Tracing Framework - (System Introspection) Crossbow Network Virtualization and Resource Control SMF Service Management Facility FMA Fault Management Architecture COMSTAR Common Multiprotocol SCSI TARget - (ISCSI Target Framework) KVM Kernel Virtual Machine - (Operating System Virtualization) Zones OS Level Virtualized Application Containers Time-Slider Automated ZFS Snapshots and Rollbacks RBAC Role-Based Access Control IPMP IP Network Multipathing DLMP Data Link Multipathing What is the OpenIndiana release schedule? Approximately every six months, the OpenIndiana project releases a snapshot of the Hipster rolling release branch. Ideally suited for both workstations and servers, simply choose the installer type which best serves your needs. Workstation Server Live installer (Gnome desktop) Text installer (command line console) NOTE: The legacy oi-dev-151x branch is no longer maintained. While upgrades to Hipster are possible, the most trouble free method is to perform a clean install. CAUTION: Hipster is a rapid development branch where software versions are frequently updated. While every package is tested to ensure stability, caution is nevertheless warranted when deploying Hipster into mission critical production environments. What are the recommended hardware specifications? CPU Disk Space Memory (RAM) 64 Bit 20GB (or more) 2GB (or more) NOTE: For the best performance (and to reduce the possibility of disk swapping), allocate 4GB RAM or more. For desktops, ensure total system memory (RAM + swap) are at least 4GB or greater. The default size of the OpenIndiana swap file is 50% of installed memory. Minimum and maximum default swap allocations are 512MB and 32GB respectively. Does OpenIndiana support internationalization and localization? Yes, when installing OpenIndiana, you may choose from 47 different keyboard layouts and 22 different languages. Does OpenIndiana provide security and bug fixes? Yes, absolutely. For the actively maintained Hipster rolling release, the OpenIndiana project seeks to ensure all known flaws are quickly mitigated. For this effort to succeed, we ask our user base to diligently bring security and bugfix concerns to our attention by submitting a ticket with the OpenIndiana Bug Tracker . Where can I download OpenIndiana Hipster? Primary download mirror (London, England): ISO's and USB Images Torrents Alternate mirrors (Asia, Europe, and North America) OpenIndiana Mirrors NOTE: For detailed information about creating a bootable OpenIndiana DVD or USB flash drive, please consult the following sections of the OpenIndiana Handbook: Creating a bootable OpenIndiana DVD Creating a bootable OpenIndiana USB flash drive What package manager does OpenIndiana use? OpenIndiana uses the network based Image Packaging System (IPS) . For those coming to OpenIndiana from BSD or Linux, the IPS package manager will be an easy transition. You may also continue to use the legacy pkgadd/pkgrm commands. NOTE: The OpenIndiana distribution provides a basic set of packages, along with some extras. There are also 3rd party repositories which provide additional packages. If you wish to contribute by helping to expand package availability, please read further down about how to get involved with the OpenIndiana project. The following IPS repositories are available: Repository Name Repository URL Description openindiana.org https://pkg.openindiana.org/hipster Hipster primary package repository hipster-encumbered https://pkg.openindiana.org/hipster-encumbered Hipster encumbered license packages localhostoih http://sfe.opencsw.org/localhostoih 3rd party Spec Files Extra (SFE) packages Adding a new publisher pkg set-publisher -g repository_url repository_name Changing an existing publisher pkg set-publisher \\ -G http://pkg.openindiana.org/hipster-2015 \\ -g https://pkg.openindiana.org/hipster openindiana.org For further information about using the IPS pkg command consult the Getting Started section of the OpenIndiana Handbook as well as the pkg 1 man page included with OpenIndiana Hipster. What books are available to help with learning OpenIndiana? There are several resources which will assist you with learning to use OpenIndiana. While somewhat dated now, these resources are largely still relevant. Pro OpenSolaris A gentle and well written introduction to OpenSolaris. It weighs in at 250 pages. OpenSolaris Bible A much larger and more comprehensive reference book of nearly 1000 Pages. The illumos bookshelf Updated for illumos, the illumos bookshelf consists of several original OpenSolaris advanced administration and development titles. OpenSolaris 2009.06 Docs Originally released by the OpenSolaris project, this collection consists of over 40 titles ranging from development to systems administration. NOTE: An effort currently exists within the OpenIndiana community to review these books and provide errata. A longer term goal is to use the errata to revise and condense these titles into a significantly smaller collection which more closely follows the current development state of OpenIndiana Hipster. The documentation team is also working to produce an updated OpenIndiana handbook as well as task based tutorials. If you wish to participate in this effort, please indicate your interest via the IRC channels or the mailing lists. How can I contact OpenIndiana community?

I believe, you want something new. You'll get it. New ISOs were just uploaded to dlc server . Let's see what has changed. First of all, most evident changes were made in desktop area. We've updated Xorg server and libraries, which allowed us to incorporate some important security fixes from Oracle x-s12-clone and Debian Xorg. Also we've moved much more closely to Gnome 2.32. Most packages were updated to this level, excluding packages which either have a lot of specific patches (like gdm) or just dropped some significant functionality (like cheese, which dropped HAL support in version 2.32). Not everything has gone smoothly. We had to drop trusted desktop support during update. I believe nobody seriously used it under OI. The most annoying thing is that updated Xorg and Intel driver require some DRM updates, which are still not ready. So, if you have Intel video card, either pkg freeze X-incorporation and xorg, or use vesa driver.

The libraries were published in their current form to http://dlc.openindiana.org/c++-libs/ , so you can grub necessary libraries and LD_PRELOAD them or use in alternative path if necessary. All X/g++/Y packages are renamed to X/Y and moved from /usr/g++ to /usr. We continue delivering system/library/c++/sunpro for the foreseeable future. Text installer was changed to install OI on EFI-labeled disk by default. Note, in this case the entire disk is erased. If you want to install OI on MBR-labeled disk, choose partitioned install. Desktop software and libraries A lot of desktop libraries were updated Glib2 is updated to 2.43.4 GTK2 is updated to 2.24.27 pango is updated to 1.36.8 cairo is updated to 1.14.2 libdrm is updated to 2.4.59 libX11 is updated to 1.6.2, xcb support is enabled in libX11 xf86-video-ati driver updated to 6.4.16 nvidia proprietary driver was updated to 340.76 Mesa is updated to 10.5.1 Xserver is updated to 1.12.4 with the latest available video/input Xorg drivers. This requires updating xorg drivers and modules. OI-shipped modules will be updated automatically, but if you use VirtualBox, you'll have to update your guest additions to at least 4.3.22 version. Enlightenment 0.19.3 is added as alternative desktop environment fontconfig was updated to 2.11.1 libid3tag and libmtp were imported from SFE, gmtp is added rdesktop is updated to 1.8.3 transmission is updated to 2.52 XScreensaver is updated to 5.32 gnome-commander is updated to 1.4.5 QT 4.8.6 is added emacs is updated to 24.3 Input Method Selector was added from upstream input-method gate. Bug in svc:/application/desktop-cache/input-method-cache:default service preventing correct input methods functioning in recent OI was fixed. In fact, gtk input modules cache was moved from /etc/(amd64/)gtk-2.0/gtk.immodules to /usr/lib/(amd64/)gtk-2.0/2.10.0/immodules.cache and service has to regenerate these cache files in new locations. So, after update you can safely remove /etc/(amd64/)gtk-2.0/gtk.immodules .

There's also a lot of security fixes and small bug fixes. Of course, I had more ideas than spare time, so some of them were not implemented. We still don't have PHP 5.6 and our OpenOffice package still doesn't work with XML-based document formats. I've looked at replacing cpp with one based on Schilix version, but unfortunately I found it to be not always compatible with Sun cpp. So, I've chosen preserve the status quo and we still deliver Sun cpp. I still would like to see postfix as first class MTA in OI. I'd like to share some more ideas, which attract me now. First of all, we consider further updating of Xorg and other former xnv components (libXfont, freetype). GCC update is also on the roadmap.

Note, we don't speak about release and prefer \"snapshot\" term. General system changes We synced IPS with Everycity version, which includes Oracle updates and fixes necessary for IPS to work on illumos. Two major changes from previous IPS shipped with OpenIndiana Hipster - now we have Python 2.7 IPS version (in addition to Python 2.6 one) and linked image is default zone type now. IPS knows about zones and enforces some restrictions - for example, now GZ's publisher list should be subset of NGS's publisher list. Also distribution constructor was updated to use Python 2.7. Other changes include some preparations to support non-grub boot loaders. Text installer now creates separate FS for /var file system. We included text installer in GUI ISO images. The main issue with GUI installer is that it is written in C and there's no one supporting it. Text installer, written in python, is easier to maintain, so it gets more attention. So, GUI installer can be dropped in the next snapshot if we don't find people interested in syncing it with upstream and supporting it. GUI ISO images will be provided in any case. Base Perl version was changed to 5.22. Support for 5.16 is retained. Perl 5.10 was completely removed, so you have to set PERL_VERSION=\"5.22\" and PERL_PKGVERS=\"-522\" in your illumos.sh to build illumos-gate. Sun JDK/JRE were completely removed and replaced with OpenJDK. OpenJDK was updated to 1.7.76. Desktop software and libraries Xorg-related software is updated Xorg is updated to 1.14.7. Updating to later version (1.17.2) requires additional work on radeon(7) driver, as our current driver doesn't work with updated Xorg and later versions require KMS support. libXft is updated to 2.3.2 libX11 is updated to 1.6.3 libXext is updated to 1.3.3 freetype is updated to 2.5.5 nvidia proprietary driver is updated to 340.93 xauth is updated to 1.0.7 libdrm is updated to 2.4.65 libICE is updated to 1.0.9 xfs is updated to 1.1.4 Upstream Pulseaudio version (1.1) is integrated, gnome-volume-applet is removed. To use pulseaudio with gstreamer, launch gstreamer-properties and ensure that default output is set to \"Autodetect\" or \"PulseAudio Sound Server\".

Two major changes from previous IPS shipped with OpenIndiana Hipster - now we have Python 2.7 IPS version (in addition to Python 2.6 one) and linked image is default zone type now. IPS knows about zones and enforces some restrictions - for example, now GZ's publisher list should be subset of NGS's publisher list. Also distribution constructor was updated to use Python 2.7. Other changes include some preparations to support non-grub boot loaders. Text installer now creates separate FS for /var file system. We included text installer in GUI ISO images. The main issue with GUI installer is that it is written in C and there's no one supporting it. Text installer, written in python, is easier to maintain, so it gets more attention. So, GUI installer can be dropped in the next snapshot if we don't find people interested in syncing it with upstream and supporting it. GUI ISO images will be provided in any case. Base Perl version was changed to 5.22. Support for 5.16 is retained. Perl 5.10 was completely removed, so you have to set PERL_VERSION=\"5.22\" and PERL_PKGVERS=\"-522\" in your illumos.sh to build illumos-gate.

These changes are also available to existing installations via the pkg update && pkg upgrade procedure. General system changes The most notable change for users is migration to the FreeBSD Loader . After installing new packages the next beadm activate will activate the new loader and remove GRUB. See here for additional information, possible issues, and configuration help. This improvement allows us to modify the text installer so that it can be installed with the operating system on RAIDZ/mirror ZFS pools. Intel KMS (based on Oracle's version) was ported to OpenIndiana by Martin Bochnig. The current implementation has some rough edges and supports only 6th and 7th generation of Intel video adapters. However, it is clearly a giant step forward for desktop users. Python 2.6 was removed. Python 2.7 is default system python now. Sun SSH was completely removed. Unfortunately, due to a bug in IPS (which is already fixed in newer versions), the package update can fail because of packages being renamed relating to Sun SSH removal. If you see this error: Action upgrade failed for 'etc/ssh/sshd_config' (pkg://openindiana.org/service/network/ssh): TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable during system update, then edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config with your favorite text editor and, for example, add an empty line to it. This will allow you to proceed and get into an updated operating system (including the new IPS version which has this bug fixed). Mate 1.14 was integrated. It is installed by default with new GUI installations. GDM was replaced by lightdm. If you want to install it on an existing installation, just update your system and run: pkg install mate_install pkg uninstall mate_install to install the metapackage, which pulls all needed packages, and then remove the metapackage itself. One more noticeable change in the installer \u2013 now it generates full USB images , which can be directly copied to USB sticks. 1G/2G header files are longer required. Please note that openindiana is moving towards a pure 64-bit environment. 32-bit support is obsolete and will be entirely removed in a future release. Desktop software and libraries Mate 1.14 was integrated Firefox was updated to 45.4.0 Thunderbird was updated to 45.4.0 Mesa was updated to 12.0.3 Xorg libraries, fonts and tools were updated, including freetype-2, fontconfig and other.

After installing new packages the next beadm activate will activate the new loader and remove GRUB. See here for additional information, possible issues, and configuration help. This improvement allows us to modify the text installer so that it can be installed with the operating system on RAIDZ/mirror ZFS pools. Intel KMS (based on Oracle's version) was ported to OpenIndiana by Martin Bochnig. The current implementation has some rough edges and supports only 6th and 7th generation of Intel video adapters. However, it is clearly a giant step forward for desktop users. Python 2.6 was removed. Python 2.7 is default system python now. Sun SSH was completely removed. Unfortunately, due to a bug in IPS (which is already fixed in newer versions), the package update can fail because of packages being renamed relating to Sun SSH removal. If you see this error: Action upgrade failed for 'etc/ssh/sshd_config' (pkg://openindiana.org/service/network/ssh): TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable during system update, then edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config with your favorite text editor and, for example, add an empty line to it. This will allow you to proceed and get into an updated operating system (including the new IPS version which has this bug fixed). Mate 1.14 was integrated. It is installed by default with new GUI installations. GDM was replaced by lightdm. If you want to install it on an existing installation, just update your system and run: pkg install mate_install pkg uninstall mate_install to install the metapackage, which pulls all needed packages, and then remove the metapackage itself. One more noticeable change in the installer \u2013 now it generates full USB images , which can be directly copied to USB sticks. 1G/2G header files are longer required. Please note that openindiana is moving towards a pure 64-bit environment. 32-bit support is obsolete and will be entirely removed in a future release.","title":"General system changes"},{"location":"release-notes/2016.10-release-notes/#desktop-software-and-libraries","text":"Mate 1.14 was integrated Firefox was updated to 45.4.0 Thunderbird was updated to 45.4.0 Mesa was updated to 12.0.3 Xorg libraries, fonts and tools were updated, including freetype-2, fontconfig and other.

The signature is still correct. * Run: digest -a sha256 <ISO> and check the ISO checksum as previously. General system changes The most notable change for this snapshot is related to hardware support. OI now fully supports USB 3.0 devices. Intel Video drivers were significantly improved by Gordon Ross. The list of supported hardware has significantly extended. Xorg was updated to 1.18.4 version, so if you use any third-party modules \u2013 they might need recompilation or update (notably, the VirtualBox Guest Additions). Mate was updated to 1.16 version. We started shipping GTK3 applications. Several Gnome 2 applications, which don't have Mate analogs, were updated to Gnome 3 versions. A lot of end user applications are delivered now as 64-bit only. Installer no longer creates the classic auto_home layout, as it was a source of confusion to the users. Default home filesystem is created under rpool/export/home now. Old-school users or those with more complicated setups are free to set up the legacy configuration in their systems, the functionality is still there. We thoroughly tested IPS and imported several upstream fixes. Now IPS uses Apache 2.4 as its internal web server. GNU TLS 3.4 is the default TLS implementation now. We also introduced ca-certificates service to regenerate the CA bundle. Notice: on some resource-constrained systems ca-certificates service can fail to start immediately after system install. Later SMF takes care and restarts it, but you can see error messages on first boot. The issue is being investigated. Notice: if you upgrade from earlier versions, you can see errors about failing metainit service. It was removed from the system, but SMF fails to notice it. Just remove the service manually for now in this case: # svcadm disable -s svc:/system/metainit ; svccfg delete svc:/system/metainit Desktop software and libraries Xorg was updated to 1.18.4, xorg libraries and drivers were updated. Mate was updated to 1.16 Intel video driver was updated, the list of supported hardware has significantly extended libsmb was updated to 4.4.6 gvfs was updated to 1.26.0 gtk3 was updated to 3.18.9 Nimbus theme was updated to look better with GTK3, so we started shipping GTK3 applications Rhythmbox was updated to 3.4.1 Major text editors were updated (we ship vim 8.0.104, joe 4.4, emacs 25.2, nano 2.7.5 pulseaudio was updated to 10.0 firefox was updated to 45.9.0 thunderbird was updated to 45.8.0 critical issue in enlightenment was fixed, now it's operational again privoxy was updated to 3.0.26 cdrtools were updated to 3.02a7 gthumb was updated to 3.2.9.1 brasero was updated to 3.12.1 critical issue in sound-juicer was fixed, now it's operational again Gstreamer 1.10.3 and gstreamer 1.0 plugins were integrated WebkitGTK2 was updated to 2.14.5 Mesa was updated to 13.0.6 Nvidia driver was updated to 340.102 Development tools and libraries GCC 6 was added.

OI now fully supports USB 3.0 devices. Intel Video drivers were significantly improved by Gordon Ross. The list of supported hardware has significantly extended. Xorg was updated to 1.18.4 version, so if you use any third-party modules \u2013 they might need recompilation or update (notably, the VirtualBox Guest Additions). Mate was updated to 1.16 version. We started shipping GTK3 applications. Several Gnome 2 applications, which don't have Mate analogs, were updated to Gnome 3 versions. A lot of end user applications are delivered now as 64-bit only. Installer no longer creates the classic auto_home layout, as it was a source of confusion to the users. Default home filesystem is created under rpool/export/home now. Old-school users or those with more complicated setups are free to set up the legacy configuration in their systems, the functionality is still there. We thoroughly tested IPS and imported several upstream fixes. Now IPS uses Apache 2.4 as its internal web server. GNU TLS 3.4 is the default TLS implementation now. We also introduced ca-certificates service to regenerate the CA bundle. Notice: on some resource-constrained systems ca-certificates service can fail to start immediately after system install. Later SMF takes care and restarts it, but you can see error messages on first boot. The issue is being investigated. Notice: if you upgrade from earlier versions, you can see errors about failing metainit service. It was removed from the system, but SMF fails to notice it. Just remove the service manually for now in this case: # svcadm disable -s svc:/system/metainit ; svccfg delete svc:/system/metainit","title":"General system changes"},{"location":"release-notes/2017.04-release-notes/#desktop-software-and-libraries","text":"Xorg was updated to 1.18.4, xorg libraries and drivers were updated.

The signature is still correct. General system changes Xorg was updated to 1.19.5 (Note, that if you run OI as VirtualBox guest, you should switch to vesa driver, as latest VirtualBox guest additions (currently 5.1.30 or 5.2.0) don't provide Solaris xorg drivers for Xorg 1.19). An issue causing Xorg being launched as root was fixed. Mate was updated to 1.18 version. IIIM (Internet/Intranet Input Method Framework) is not delivered by default on GUI image (IBus is shipped instead) and will be removed soon. Installer was reworked to configure XKB for switching keyboard layouts in Mate (when it is installed). US layout is always the default one. Additional layout is selected based on chosen language. Text installer now can perform basic OpenIndiana installation to existing ZFS pool (for example, in parallel to existing OpenIndiana installation). The option is considered advanced and should be used with care, but allows you to install minimal OI system to existing pool. To use it, press F5 on 'Welcome' screen. Cluster suite was updated. We've worked with MongoDB developers to fix several issues in MongoDB 3.4 component. The possibility of running MongoDB OI buildbot is being investigated. We've started to remove Gnome 2 applications and libraries. Be warned if (by some strange reason) you still haven't switched to Mate. ABI compatibility for Solaris 10u10 binaries was added. Desktop software and libraries Xorg was updated to 1.19.5, xorg libraries and drivers were updated. Mate was updated to 1.18 Enlightenment was updated to 0.21.8 Firefox was updated to 52.4.1 VLC was updated to 2.2.6 Thunderbird was updated to 52.4.0 Lightdm now properly interacts with Solaris-specific Xorg interface, allowing X server to drop privileges. several issues in time-slider were fixed (complex configurations with multiple included/excluded filesystems are fixed, zfs-send plugin is working again) libjpeg was updated to 1.5.2 Gstreamer and gstreamer plugins were updated to 1.12.3 WebkitGTK2 was updated to 2.16.6 btltty was updated to 5.5 Nvidia driver was updated to 340.104 goffice was updated to ABI-incompatible 0.10.35 version, all dependent software should be recompiled Common tools and libraries zsh was updated to 5.3.1 mc was updated to 4.8.19 tmux was updated to 2.6, screen - to 4.6.1 tcpdump was updated to 4.9.2 mutt was updated to 1.9.0 fish 2.6 was added GNU sed was updated to 4.4 GNU awk was updated to 4.1.4 GOST support was addded to OpenSSL Development tools and libraries GCC 7 was added.

OpenJDK 8 was updated to 1.8.131 Tcl/Tk were updated to 8.6.6. Third-party modules likely should be recompiled/reinstalled due to the change of the search path.

An issue causing Xorg being launched as root was fixed. Mate was updated to 1.18 version. IIIM (Internet/Intranet Input Method Framework) is not delivered by default on GUI image (IBus is shipped instead) and will be removed soon. Installer was reworked to configure XKB for switching keyboard layouts in Mate (when it is installed). US layout is always the default one. Additional layout is selected based on chosen language. Text installer now can perform basic OpenIndiana installation to existing ZFS pool (for example, in parallel to existing OpenIndiana installation). The option is considered advanced and should be used with care, but allows you to install minimal OI system to existing pool. To use it, press F5 on 'Welcome' screen. Cluster suite was updated. We've worked with MongoDB developers to fix several issues in MongoDB 3.4 component. The possibility of running MongoDB OI buildbot is being investigated. We've started to remove Gnome 2 applications and libraries. Be warned if (by some strange reason) you still haven't switched to Mate.

The signature is still correct. General system changes Userland software is rebuilt with GCC 6. As old GCC 4 runtime libraries are still delivered to /usr/lib, automatic checks and cleanup is applied to remove harmful RUNPATHs (/usr/lib, /usr/lib/amd64 and so on) from binaries. illumos-gate is still compiled with patched GCC 4.4. Kernel Page-Table Isolation (KPTI) was enabled to mitigate recent security issues in Intel CPUs (thanks to Joyent's Alex Wilson, John Levon, and Robert Mustacchi for their hard work on this). GNOME 2 desktop was removed. A lot of applications were fixed not to depend on GNOME 2 libraries (including OpenIndiana-specific software like Network Auto-Magic GUI (nwam-manager), Time Slider and GUI installer). Linked images support was enhanced to include zoneproxy support, so that ipkg zones without connection to Internet can update their software via global zone's proxy. Administration documentation is available in zones section of OpenIndiana Handbook. MATE desktop applications are now delivered as 64-bit-only. UPower was integrated. Internet/Intranet Input Method (IIIM) was removed (IBus is kept). Work on delivering 64-bit-only applications continues. Note, that although shipped ISO and USB images support booting in UEFI mode, it's still work in progress. VGA console is not supported when system is booted in UEFI mode and installer still misses some steps to create bootable UEFI images. Desktop software and libraries GNOME 2 was removed. Corresponding GNOME 3 applications were added where necessary ( totem , gnome-keyring , seahorse , vino among others). libunique, at-spi, libgnome-desktop and Python GNOME bindings were removed. Dependent applications were ported to pure GTK2/GTK3. Removal of GNOME 2 libraries is still in progress. Xorg server was updated to version 1.19.6, Xorg libraries and drivers were also updated as well. VirtualBox video driver compatible with Xorg 1.19 is available . UPower 0.99.7 and MATE Power Manager were added. ConsoleKit patches to support Suspend/Hibernate D-Bus API were backported. LightDM and MATE applications were updated to work with the new ConsoleKit functionality. MATE was recompiled as 64-bit and applications updated to latest versions of 1.18 branch. Firefox was updated to 52.7.3 VLC was updated to 2.2.8 Thunderbird was updated to 52.7.0 NVIDIA driver was updated to 340.106 Gnumeric was updated to 1.12.39 Note that PulseAudio is now delivered as 64-bit application and as a consequence its configuration files are now incompatible with the previous version. If pulseaudio fails to start after the update, just remove ~/.config/pulse directory. Common tools and libraries zsh was updated to 5.4.2 Midnight Commander was updated to 4.8.20 fish was updated to 2.7.0 Development tools and libraries GCC 6.4.0 is the default OpenIndiana userland compiler. GCC 7 was updated to 7.3.0 Jenkins was updated to 2.89.4 (LTS) and 2.108 OpenJDK 8 was updated to 1.8.162 Erlang was updated to 19.3 Mercurial was updated to 4.5.3 git was updated to 2.16.2 Memcached was updated to 1.4.37 PHP versions were updated to 5.6.35 and 7.0.29 Server software PostgreSQL versions 9.4 thru 10 were updated to their latest minor versions. PostgreSQL 9.3 was removed (9.4 is the default now). MariaDB 10.1, Percona Server 5.6 and 5.7 were updated to latest minor versions. CouchDB 2.1 was added. ISC Bind was updated to 9.10.6-P1 ISC DHCP server was updated to 4.3.6-P1 Squid was updated to 3.5.27 nginx was updated to 1.14.0 Apache HTTP 2.4 was updated to 2.4.33 Samba was updated to 4.5.16 Node.js was updated to 6.14.0 and 8.11.1 A lot of other bug fixes and minor software updates are included. Several significant OpenIndiana userland changes were introduced. In resolve step pkgdepend resolve searches for dependencies only in REQUIRED_PACKAGES and packages, provided by current component. OpenIndiana userland automatic tooling now detects and removes standard library directories from RUNPATH ( /lib , /usr/lib , /lib/$(MACH64) , /usr/lib/$(MACH64) ). Component build bitness (i.e. whether to deliver 64-bit binaries in /usr/bin ) now can be controlled by PREFERRED_BITS macros (64 or 32, defaults to 32). It's worth noting that automated test tool/framework performs installation image generation and testing on a frequent basis.

As old GCC 4 runtime libraries are still delivered to /usr/lib, automatic checks and cleanup is applied to remove harmful RUNPATHs (/usr/lib, /usr/lib/amd64 and so on) from binaries. illumos-gate is still compiled with patched GCC 4.4. Kernel Page-Table Isolation (KPTI) was enabled to mitigate recent security issues in Intel CPUs (thanks to Joyent's Alex Wilson, John Levon, and Robert Mustacchi for their hard work on this). GNOME 2 desktop was removed. A lot of applications were fixed not to depend on GNOME 2 libraries (including OpenIndiana-specific software like Network Auto-Magic GUI (nwam-manager), Time Slider and GUI installer). Linked images support was enhanced to include zoneproxy support, so that ipkg zones without connection to Internet can update their software via global zone's proxy. Administration documentation is available in zones section of OpenIndiana Handbook. MATE desktop applications are now delivered as 64-bit-only. UPower was integrated. Internet/Intranet Input Method (IIIM) was removed (IBus is kept). Work on delivering 64-bit-only applications continues. Note, that although shipped ISO and USB images support booting in UEFI mode, it's still work in progress. VGA console is not supported when system is booted in UEFI mode and installer still misses some steps to create bootable UEFI images.","title":"General system changes"},{"location":"release-notes/2018.04-release-notes/#desktop-software-and-libraries","text":"GNOME 2 was removed. Corresponding GNOME 3 applications were added where necessary ( totem , gnome-keyring , seahorse , vino among others). libunique, at-spi, libgnome-desktop and Python GNOME bindings were removed. Dependent applications were ported to pure GTK2/GTK3. Removal of GNOME 2 libraries is still in progress. Xorg server was updated to version 1.19.6, Xorg libraries and drivers were also updated as well. VirtualBox video driver compatible with Xorg 1.19 is available . UPower 0.99.7 and MATE Power Manager were added. ConsoleKit patches to support Suspend/Hibernate D-Bus API were backported. LightDM and MATE applications were updated to work with the new ConsoleKit functionality. MATE was recompiled as 64-bit and applications updated to latest versions of 1.18 branch. Firefox was updated to 52.7.3 VLC was updated to 2.2.8 Thunderbird was updated to 52.7.0 NVIDIA driver was updated to 340.106 Gnumeric was updated to 1.12.39 Note that PulseAudio is now delivered as 64-bit application and as a consequence its configuration files are now incompatible with the previous version.

New features 8158 Named Threads API was added. 6375 Native name demangling support for C++ was added (binary-only libdemangle.so from Sun Studio is still present). 9815 Basic AHCI enclosure services. 1700 Add SCSI UNMAP support. 8115 Parallel zfs mount is now supported. 9782 eventfd(3C) event notification works in zones. 9664 Support for UEFI32 (even on 64-bit machines) was added. 8548 memset_s(3C) was ported from FreeBSD. Important changes A lot of fixes by Toomas Soome make illumos closer to be compiled by GCC 7 and newer compilers. 9812 headers are now free from excessive SUS compiler checks, hence application porting should be easier. 9627 32-bit boot archive is not being generated. 9598 Eager FPU restore defeats side channel attacks.

Other noticeable changes include moving of some OI-specific applications from Python 2.7/GTK 2 to Python 3.5/GTK 3, merging updates from OmniOS CE IPS (including automatically named boot environments), rebuilding and fixing issues in libiconv conversion modules. Late news (known issues) Firefox can fail to spawn child processes on the first launch. After being restarted it runs fine. In some scenarios Firefox hangs or crashes. In many cases enlarging the swap helps.

The signature is still correct. General system changes During this development cycle we've worked on updating IPS, migrating remaining OpenIndiana-specific applications to Python 3, rewriting some DDU closed binary blobs. Desktop software and libraries VirtualBox was updated to 6.0.14 Xorg fonts, tools and libraries were updated. FreeType was updated to 2.10.1 GTK 3 was updated to 3.24.12 LightDM was updated to 1.30 mpg123, x265, and mpack packages were added, x264 was updated Powerline, the nice status line, was added and integrated with Bash, tmux, and Vim Supplementary x11-init service was added to create necessary directories with root permissions prior to X11 applications startup Common tools and libraries IPS was synced to the latest OmniOS CE version. Now it ships only Python 3.5 tools and libraries. to build oi-userland after removing Python 2 pkg module you need to update the userland build environment too ; to build gfx-drm you need latest developer/build/onbld package ; to build illumos-gate you have to add export BUILDPY2TOOLS=\"#\" to your illumos.sh. DDU binaries, for which we missed sources, were rewritten, DDU was converted to Python 3.5 Bash was updated top and htop now both report ARC and compressed ARC statistics Vim was updated to 8.1.1721, Nano was updated to 4.5 Sudo was updated to 1.8.29 Development tools and libraries GCC compilers were updated to 7.4.0, 8.3.0, GCC 9.2 was added (note, GCC 6.5 is still the default oi-userland compiler) Clang 8.0 was added. Clang 4.0 was removed. Git was updated to 2.23.0. CMake was updated to 3.15.1. Rust was updated to 1.32.0. Python modules were updated. Golang 1.13 was added Server software MongoDB 4.0 was updated. Nginx was updated to 1.16.1. Samba was updated to 4.11. Node.js was updated to 12.13.0, 10.17.0, and 8.16.2 BIND was updated to 9.14 OpenLDAP was updated to 2.4.48 tor was updated to 0.4.1.6 A lot of other bug fixes and minor software updates are included. illumos As always, we are proud to ship the latest illumos-gate bits ( 87d7b64 ). Some of the more interesting changes include: illumos is now build with GCC 7 by default. GCC 4.4 is kept as a shadow compiler and for SPARC (not delivered by the OpenIndiana project) PAGER variable is no longer being set. It used to be set to /usr/bin/less -ins , which caused problems for some users. man(1) still does paging via /usr/bin/less -ins when PAGER is not set. cxgbe firmware and Intel microcode were updated Various improvements and fixes were ported from the ZFS on Linux project: native data and metadata encryption sorted scans zpool ashift property is now tunable support UNMAP/TRIM for SSD (disabled by default) Log Spacemap Old DRM and AGP code was removed, the GFX DRM gate is the sole source of DRM code. Security: The L1TF mitigation (CVE-2018-3646) was integrated. Multi-architectural data sampling mitigations (various CVEs) were implemented. Hyper-threading can be disabled. Kernel is built with retpolines. A lot of SMB 3 features were merged: continuously available shares, persistent handles signing, encryption ACLs named pipes extended attributes file level locking A lot of old SPARC code (deprecated platforms and device drivers) was removed. zoneadm list 's -n option lists non-global zones only. netstat got the -u option to list PIDs associated with sockets NVMe improvements (e.g. drive firmware updates). mandoc was updated to 1.14.5. Code of Conduct was adopted. Rust got MDB symbol demangling support. XHCI polled mode is supported for USB keyboards. nawk was updated to NAWK upstream circa 2018 code. The NULL macro is casted to type void * (a requirement POSIX.1-2008). The C.UTF-8 locale is provided. Added reallocf(3C) function. FreeBSD's pluggable congestion control framework was ported, enabling CUBIC and NewReno algorithms, which have higher performance than \"sunreno\" in some circumstances. The default algorithm for new passwords is SHA512 crontab(1) now supports \"/step\", e.g.: */2 * * * * echo \"run every two minutes\" UEFI boot improvements: bootadm install-bootloader (or installboot if run directly) now populates/maintains the ESP. Bug in our keyboard driver, which prevented SPICE display mechanism of the Linux KVM to work properly, was fixed. Other activities A lot of work was done to update documentation from outdated wiki and move it to new docs site and oi-userland docs .

Some of the more interesting changes include: illumos is now build with GCC 7 by default. GCC 4.4 is kept as a shadow compiler and for SPARC (not delivered by the OpenIndiana project) PAGER variable is no longer being set. It used to be set to /usr/bin/less -ins , which caused problems for some users. man(1) still does paging via /usr/bin/less -ins when PAGER is not set. cxgbe firmware and Intel microcode were updated Various improvements and fixes were ported from the ZFS on Linux project: native data and metadata encryption sorted scans zpool ashift property is now tunable support UNMAP/TRIM for SSD (disabled by default) Log Spacemap Old DRM and AGP code was removed, the GFX DRM gate is the sole source of DRM code. Security: The L1TF mitigation (CVE-2018-3646) was integrated. Multi-architectural data sampling mitigations (various CVEs) were implemented. Hyper-threading can be disabled. Kernel is built with retpolines. A lot of SMB 3 features were merged: continuously available shares, persistent handles signing, encryption ACLs named pipes extended attributes file level locking A lot of old SPARC code (deprecated platforms and device drivers) was removed. zoneadm list 's -n option lists non-global zones only. netstat got the -u option to list PIDs associated with sockets NVMe improvements (e.g. drive firmware updates). mandoc was updated to 1.14.5. Code of Conduct was adopted. Rust got MDB symbol demangling support. XHCI polled mode is supported for USB keyboards. nawk was updated to NAWK upstream circa 2018 code. The NULL macro is casted to type void * (a requirement POSIX.1-2008). The C.UTF-8 locale is provided. Added reallocf(3C) function. FreeBSD's pluggable congestion control framework was ported, enabling CUBIC and NewReno algorithms, which have higher performance than \"sunreno\" in some circumstances. The default algorithm for new passwords is SHA512 crontab(1) now supports \"/step\", e.g.: */2 * * * * echo \"run every two minutes\" UEFI boot improvements: bootadm install-bootloader (or installboot if run directly) now populates/maintains the ESP. Bug in our keyboard driver, which prevented SPICE display mechanism of the Linux KVM to work properly, was fixed.","title":"illumos"},{"location":"release-notes/2019.10-release-notes/#other-activities","text":"A lot of work was done to update documentation from outdated wiki and move it to new docs site and oi-userland docs .","title":"Other activities"},{"location":"release-notes/2019.10-release-notes/#contributors","text":"Following developers contributed to the 2019.10 snapshot with more than 600 commits.

The signature is still correct. General system changes All OpenIndiana system software was rewritten in Python 3. Installation images now don't deliver Python 2.7 interpreters or libraries, however some software still requires Python 2.7. We've moved to GCC 7 as the default compiler. Desktop software and libraries LibreOffice 6.4.3 was added. There are some issues with GTK 3 theme, so \"gen\" VCL plugin is used by default. You can experiment with GTK3 plugin, setting SAL_USE_VCLPLUGIN environment variable to gtk3 explicitly. VirtualBox was updated to 6.1.6. There are some issues with direct and VNC consoles with non-EFI guests.

We created an own totem fork to import upstream patches and remove the dependency on Python 2.7. UPower was updated to 0.99.11 Mate Power Manager policy was adjusted to avoid suspending computer unless specifically overwritten by the user due to issues with wakeup on modern hardware. XScreensaver was updated to 5.44 Gnome Connection Manager was updated to 1.2.0 MiniDLNA was added XChat was removed Common tools and libraries Caiman installer was switched to Python 3.5 PKG was updated to use rapidjson instead of simplejson for json processing which reduced memory consumption on operations with large package catalogues DDU security issue, allowing a local attacker to gain root privileges under some rare cases, was fixed net-snmp was updated to 5.8 Sudo was updated to 1.8.31 mozilla-nspr libraries were updated to 4.25 SQLite was updated to 3.31.1 OpenConnect was updated to 8.05, vpnc-scripts to 20190606 version GNU Screen was updated to 4.8.0 tmux was updated to 3.0a nano was updated to 4.8 Development tools and libraries GCC compilers were updated to 7.5.0, 8.4, 9.3.

Update instructions: To install new perl-516 firstly update perl-510. Old perl-510 ships hardlinks. It was updated to install mediated links. Note, it is just old repackaged perl 5.10.0 from /dev compiled with Sun Studio, only manifest was patched to deliver mediated links. Perl 5.10 is still used while compiling illumos-gate. If you just update old library/perl-5/database and other modules you'll receive new packages, which are just meta-packages, new packages will likely pull library/perl-5/*-516 packages and you'll stay without old modules, so remember to install corresponding library/perl-5/*-5100 packages after update (if someone is interested 5100 stands for perl 5.10.0).","title":"Latest OpenIndiana changes"},{"location":"retired/","text":"openindiana-docs This repository is for the development of OpenIndiana systems documentation as well as additional work products to help promote and improve all areas of the OpenIndiana project.

Obviously maintaining 41 different titles is no easy matter. Therefore, the number one thing we can do to improve the books is to consolidate them into a more manageable set of fewer volumes. In reviewing these books, there looks to be some crossover between titles. For example, it might be possible to merge the Solaris Express collection into the Systems Administration collection, etc. Current Situation The source code used for the redistributable books is Solbook XML 3.5 (and in some cases Solbook XML 3.6). Solbook is a creation of Sun Microsystems and is a simplified subset of Docbook. We have a conversion tool (written in JAVA) which can handle the conversion of Solbook XML 3.5 to HTML 4.5, but we do not have DTD's for any other XML versions (e.g 3.6). Assuming the differences between the XML versions are not too great, we might be able to trick the java conversion tool by simply changing the version number within the DTD. This is speculative and not yet been tried. Its unclear whether the books found in the 2009.09.15 drop are inclusive of all the 2008.11 books. Some of the titles are different. We have the source for the 2009.06 books, but not for the 2008.11 books. Challenges for working with the OpenSolaris Books Solbook XML is difficult to work with. Hard to read Hard to edit Requires validation after editing Not supported by modern WYSIWIG XML editors The Solbook to html conversion tool is broken (indexing does not work). Conversion of the books is a manual process. We have no automated way to maintain these books (no automated continuous integration toolchain exists). The OpenSolaris books are full of broken links. The books all reference each other (and other non-opensource books) using the original SUN hosted URL's. Even the books revised by the illumos project have broken links (thus also need some love). There are additional challenges. The books have difficult to decipher folder and xml file names. Many of the books consist of dozens and dozens of separate xml files. The books are not particularly mobile friendly. In regard to the factual correctness of the documentation, do we ourselves even know what still works, doesn't work, has been deprecated, replaced, etc.? Future Direction We should consider converting the OpenSolaris books to some kind of simple and easy to read text based markup (e.g. ASCIIDOC, Restructured Text, Markdown, etc.). Using a text based markup would greatly lower the bar for working on the books. For books for which we do not have the XML source, perhaps pandoc can be used to reconvert the HTML back to text markup. We need to create a fully automated toolchain with the following features: Source code stored on GitHub. Commit hooks kick off an automated build (conversion to HTML5) and deployment of the books to their public location. We need to determine where to host the books - (e.g. OI website, Github pages, readthedocs.com, etc.) The docs maintenance process needs to be documented itself. Another consideration is printing. There should be printer friendly CSS used with the HTML pages. We need to eat our own dog food. The entire editing and build process should be capable of being performed on multiple platforms, including OpenIndiana. What are Other Projects Doing? In a nutshell, the trend is a move away from CMS systems. With recent advances in mobile friendly dynamic CSS frameworks and static HTML website baking tools, the future looks to be static HTML5. Some projects (such as Jenkins) make no distinction between documentation and the rest of their web content. Everything is treated equally and managed using the very same tools. PC-PCD The PC-BSD project looks to be hosting their website on a CMS (Wordpress). The project uses the python based Sphinx documentation framework (which uses the Restructured Text markup language). Documentation is self hosted (though most projects using Sphinx host using Read The Docs ). Jenkins The Jenkins project is composed entirely of static HTML5 and uses Awestruct to bake their website. Their CSS framework is either Bootstrap, Foundation, or possibly even custom fabricated (it's not clear how they're doing it). Asciidoctor is their markup language for all content (docs, blog posts, news, etc.). All content is hosted on GitHub and continuous integration (automated build and deploy) is presumably via their own Jenkins CI. FreeBSD It's unclear how the FreeBSD project is hosting their website. Given the website's responsiveness, there is a good chance they're hosting static HTML. For documentation, the FreeBSD project uses Docbook 5 along with a semi-automated XML toolchain to validate and convert the source code to other formats. The FreeBSD project hosts their Docbook 5 XML source in a single subversion repository where you check out the entire project. Similar to the Jenkins project, there is a good chance the FreeBSD project makes no distinction between their docs and other content.

Update the welcome HTML: https://github.com/OpenIndiana/openindiana-welcome/blob/master/data/html/en/index.html Wiki Improvements Wiki Usability on Mobile Devices The OpenIndiana Wiki does not render well on mobile devices. The left hand navigation menu is completely absent when browsing the Wiki from Android phones and tablets. Possible solutions: Add in page navigation menus Replace the Wiki with a mobile aware Wiki Replace the Wiki with a user forum Replace the Wiki as part of a larger web presence transformation Need to Create a Wiki Style Guide Should the Wiki be retained, it may be helpful to create a Wiki style guide. This would be very helpful by ensuring consistency between the different pages. It may also be helpful to modify the existing CSS to help improve the aesthetics of the site. Possible suggestions This would be very helpful for providing some consistency between different pages. Use horizontal lines (top and bottom) to separate code blocks from the text body. Makes it easier to tell what is or isn't code. Also provides for a more efficient use of space (don't have to use so many line breaks). Develop standards for displaying certain types of information...e.g. code blocks, commands, tips, warnings, info, etc. consider whether it's possible to enable Wiki page navigation by placing breadcrumbs navigational elements within the page itself, rather than relying entirely on Wiki navigation menu in left hand navigation pane. Can look at other Illumos Wikis for ideas and inspiration https://Wiki.smartos.org/display/DOC/Doc+Team+Notes http://omnios.omniti.com/Wiki.php/WikiStart http://Wiki.illumos.org/display/illumos/illumos+Home Some notes for updating Wiki pages While replacing the Wiki with some kind of continuous integration content management system would likely be the most ideal solution, there are still things which can be done to help improve the Wiki. Clean up old user comments Many, many comments from 2010 - 2012. Probably a good idea to clean these up and incorporated the information into the page as appropriate. Comments with such old timestamps suggests little site activity has occurred in last 4-5 years. Mark old pages for deprecation Go through the Wiki and mark content as obsolete. Retain items of value and either pull them into the new handbook (if it's helpful for new users), or set it aside for reference when updating the OpenSolaris books. Reorganize things which are not being moved. WordPress Improvements Improve the presentation of reference materials illumos and OpenIndiana HCL's Start a discussion about ways to improve and update this. Illumos HLC: https://www.illumos.org/hcl/ Publishing man pages online Start a discussion about getting the Hipster man pages published. illumos core man pages are available on illumos.org OI specific man pages are not published. <leoric> looking at Ubuntu dhcp.conf online man page, I thought it would be good to have automatic extractor and search interface, extracting man pages from package repository and publishing them on OI site... <alanc> http://illumos.org/man/ covers the illumos ones, but not all the other packages <leoric> I know about illumos man pages, but thought about all available man pages <alanc> yeah, I figured that's what you meant Links to source code Talk about the links to the source code and what can be found in each repository. https://hg.openindiana.org/sustaining/ https://hg.openindiana.org/upstream/ The future of OpenIndiana's web presence The current OI website is a marked improvement over what previously existed. But anything that is already good can be further improved. We should begin a strategic discussion about the future direction of web content in general. e.g. do we continue using CMS systems, or start looking at static html? Wondering if we can expand on the Hipster name, perhaps by theming the website in a similar manor. Hipster denotes something trendy, or in fashion, etc., the website theme should exploit this in some way. Could try something some like big fashionable buttons as follows: Button label URL points to Get it Hipster Downloads Install it Installation Guidance/Tutorials/Instructions Use it Hipster Handbook Discuss it OI Mailing lists/IRC, etc. Extend it Developer Handbook Favicon Can we add the OI favicon to WordPress like we see on the Wiki? Mobile Devices Due to the dark blue color scheme, this menu is hard to see and easily missed. Maybe we should put something on the front page mentioning the mobile menu which is available in the upper left hand corner. Perhaps the color of the 3 bars mobile menu can be changed to white or something? Other Thoughts (in no particular order) Add some links to the Community > Getting Involved page. #oi-dev IRC chat archives #openindiana IRC chat archives oi-dev mailing list archives openindiana mailing list archives twitter @openindiana Have redirects (mailing lists, illumos links, etc., ) open into a new tab so OI webpage remains open. Move link to WIKI to a more prominent location (e.g. its own first level tab on home page). Wiki is currently listed last under documentation. More frequent updates to Latest News. Community > Security Advisories is misleading. This only leads to page to report problems, not view already reported advisories as the breadcrumbs would suggest. Perhaps we could find a way to make this more clear (e.g. Report security issues) Documentation > Gallery - Lets update the screenshots - should be from Hipster. Remove old pingbacks. They don\u2019t look to offer any real value (e.g. the download page has 68 pingbacks). Blog aggregator Post old OpenSolaris docs (as they are updated) As the books are updated, replace them. Provide PDF and Epub alternatives. Add list of mirrors, torrents, etc., to download page on website. Need to find more places to mirror, preferably some in north america too.

The ideal model would be where all informational content (docs, blog posts, news, etc.) lives in github. This way, working with informational content is simply a matter of working with familiar tools and concepts. The continuous integration content management process might go something like this: Clone the repository. Add or edit some content. Commit your changes. Send a pull request so your changes can be reviewed for inclusion into the master repository. Upon commit to the master repository, a repo hook kicks off a build and deploy of the updated content. This process can be as big or small as you like; You may wish to keep things limited to systems documentation, or the concept can be expanded to include the project's entire web presence. For the later, static website baking frameworks such as Awestruct or Jekyll along with dynamic mobile first CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap or Foundation , the entire OpenIndiana website, and all it's content, can be continuously integrated in a fully automated fashion. No Mess, No Fuss. No more databases to maintain. No more patching security holes in CMS systems. No more backups (remember the whole website lives on github, and everyone has their cloned copy of it). Everything is version controlled. For a working example of what this might look like in production, have a look at the newly updated Jenkins website . Docs are Code The most important thing to keep in mind is that docs are code. So, we treat the docs (and all other content) just as we would treat code (and use the very same tools to manage it all). Write 1 sentence per line. Use comments in your code. Use version control - fork and fix (just as you would anything else). Use TODO's. General Writing Tips Write your docs by asking a question and then answering it. Later turn the questions into sectional headings, etc. Use a thesaurus - e.g. https://www.powerthesaurus.org/ Couch read - via a phone or tablet, proof read what you previously wrote. - (puts you into the reader's shoes) What is Asciidoctor? Asciidoc is a text markdown language using a Python based interpreter. Asciidoctor is a more modern and more powerful Ruby based implementation of Asciidoc. Asciidoctor also includes some of features found in documentation frameworks such as Sphinx (which is used by the Python and PC-BSD projects). The Asciidoctor framework can be used for docs as well as for the production of other types of content (news stories, blog posts, etc.). System Characteristics Easy to use (even easier than Sphinx) TOC is easy to navigate (but not quite as clean as Sphinx) Like Sphinx, produces a very professional looking end product. Does not yet support chunked html, but can export to docbook and use docbook tools to perform this task. Supports the pulling together of several small documents using the concept of \"includes\". More flexible than Sphinx in that it can be used as part of a larger web content framework. Asciidoctor compared to Sphinx Both systems have their relative merits with advantages and disadvantages. For example if all you want to do is write and publish some docs, then Sphinx is a good choice. However, if you want to do a little more (like the Jenkins project is doing), then Asciidoctor is likely the better choice. Why a Text Markup Based Docs Framework? The primary advantage of using a text markup language is readability and flexibility. The raw code for your content is simply text. This is something you can make sense of without special tools (e.g. Docbook based WYSIWYG XML editors, etc.). Tips for Working with Asciidoctor Use \"Attributes\" and name space them - e.g. :uri-project: <url> -(place these attributes at top of document) Call your attributes in your docs like this: {uri-project} [Project name] Use \"Includes\" - e.g. include:: {uri-macros}/doc_to_import.asciidoc[] - (allows you to pull in other docs into your docs) Asciidoctor Tools and Informational Links URL Description http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/ Asciidoc Language (the syntax) http://asciidoctor.org/ Ruby based parser and tools http://discuss.asciidoctor.org/ Asciidoctor support forum http://www.asciibinder.org/index.html Asciibinder - (allows the construction of documents using includes ) https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf New Asciidoctor PDF generator (Alpha software) http://asciidocfx.com/ Java based Asciidoc IDE https://github.com/dagwieers/asciidoc-vim Asciidoc Syntax highlighting for VIM https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/asciidoctorjs-live-previe/iaalpfgpbocpdfblpnhhgllgbdbchmia Asciidoctor.js Live Preview plugin for Google Chrome Web Browser https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/asciidoctorjs-live-preview/ Asciidoctor.js Live Preview plugin for Firefox Web Browser https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-confluence Confluence plugin for Asciidoctor - (uploads to Confluence site) http://gist.asciidoctor.org/ Asciidoctor page renderer for GitHub Gist URL's https://travis-ci.org/ Continuous Integration (similar to Jenkins, etc.) https://pages.github.com/ Publish from your github repo http://hubpress.io/ Blog from your github repo - built in Asciidoctor support NOTE: In order to use the Asciidoctor Chrome extension with local files, you must enable the plugin option \"Allow access to file URLs\".
