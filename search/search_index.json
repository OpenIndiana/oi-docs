This change was implemented in preparation for the OpenSolaris 2010.03 release.The proposed release notes for OpenSolaris 2010.03 included this statement: \"CUPS support includes a web and graphical interface to manage your printing environment. A system that is running CUPS becomes a host that can accept print requests from client systems, process those requests, and then send them to the appropriate printer. To facilitate CUPS support, a new print-service command has been introduced that provides a mechanism for switching between CUPS print service and the LP print service, including 2 new SMF services.\"Doc Team Notes: Oracle Solaris dropped support for lp when they introduced CUPS in the Solaris 11.0 release. The OpenIndiana project retained both print subsystems, which are managed by the <code>print-service</code> command. Both <code>lp</code> and <code>lpr</code> are symbolically linked to <code>print-service</code>.

Gary Mills Hewlett-Packard 2710p yes ACPI works, no Wacom driver. Everything works fine, secondary port for graphics card listed as unknown, but external display works. Bryan Iotti Hewlett-Packard DV 6000 yes Works perfectly, including graphics, sound and usb Johan S Hewlett-Packard EilteBook 8760w yes WiFi fails from time to time, set \"set apix_enable=0\" in /etc/system to work-around illumos issue #1723, SDcard works, NVIDIA Graphics work (3D accelerated), webcam works, USB3 works not of course (no driver), suspend does not work correctly Olaf Bohlen Hewlett-Packard EliteBook 6930p yes Works: WiFi, Ethernet, no driver issues after disabling Intel MEI/AMT. AMD Radeon HD 3400 only works for 2D acceleration, due to missing KMS. Incomplete ACPI support: no suspend, low battery life (2hrs). Bryan Iotti Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 20A7004HRT yes Tested with July 2014 OpenIndiana Hipster ISO.Installed OI from USB drive (switched it to USB 2.0 mode in BIOS). Also selected legacy boot.Gigabit Ethernet (Intel l218-V) works with e1000g0 driver.Sound card (ddu detects Intel Haswell-ULT and Intel Lynx Point-LP HD Audio controllers) is detected, but doesn't work.Video adapter (Intel Haswell-ULT Integrated audio controller, Intel HD 4400) is recognized as VESA, but supports 1600x900 resolution.FN and functional \"keys\" work\u00a0 in general.Wireless adapter (Intel Wireles-N 7260) doesn't workTrackpad seems to be too sensitive and behaves strange.Updated at July 2019Video adapter is working with Intel KMS driver.USB 3.0 ports work fine. Alexander Pyhalov Lenovo ThinkPad Edge E335 yes The laptop has no CD drive but can boot off a USB device; to install OI I used a USB HDD with grub4dos in first partition booting an oi_151a5 ISO image and a second 1GB partition with the USB image. Note that the right (yellow USB 2.0) port MUST be used during such setup.Gigabit Ethernet (Realtek) works, especially (more stable) with an updated\u00a0gani driver from Free NIC drivers for OpenSolaris project. WiFi (Broadcom BCM4313) works with updated NDIS drivers (see source tarball in\u00a0https://www.illumos.org/issues/3367)\u00a0based on bcmwl5 64-bit variant of specific Windows driver versions, this supports WEP only. SATA support is strange (sometimes works, sometimes doesn't), so Compatibility mode (IDE) set via BIOS\u00a0is preferential. USB3 (XHCI) does not work, those two left\u00a0ports don't even power up a mouse. The USB2 port (right side)\u00a0works, also with a USB hub. Battery status and model shown OK. Card reader not visible (probably hooked to USB3 chip). Sound system includes several devices (Realtek audio powering the speakers/mini-jack, and AMD Radeon HDMI audio), both driven\u00a0as audiohd; in my case Realtek was detected as dsp1/mixer1/audio1/etc. and I had to replace the links (/dev/dsp /dev/audio /dev/mixer etc.) to force it to be used for sound by default. ALSA audio driver mode works, but with hicccups; OSS and SunAudio play music okay, but quite a bit too quiet in my testing (like 10% of the volume on the same system under another OS).Video adapter\u00a0(AMD Vision E2 APU including the CPU and Radeon GPU) is not recognized as a \"radeon\" by \"modload /kernel/drv(/amd64)/radeon\" nor by X11, but works in correct resolution (1366*768)\u00a0as \"vgatext\". Heavy video performs poorly (movies, videocamera tests), but during\u00a0normal work/reading/browsing/development lags are nearly unnoticeable.NOTE: The keyboard does not include such keys as Pause/Break and SysRQ/ScrlLock. Some can be emulated (Fn+P, Fn+B, etc.), but I did not manage to find all of them. There is also only a power LED indicator, so you don't see HDD working, CAPS lock, etc. NumLock and at least an emulated numeric keypad are missing altogether.According to repairs\u00a0docs, some variants of this laptop model can include an additional\u00a0MiniPCI socket for WAN (3G modem) or mSATA SSD; my laptop does not have this feature soldered on (or I failed to find it). Jim Klimov Lenovo Thinkpad L470 yes Lenovo ThinkCenter m91p yes Aur\u00e9lien Larcher Lenovo Thinkpad P70 yes Lenovo ThinkPad T60 yes Milan Jurik Lenovo Thinkpad T430 yes Lenovo ThinkPad T520 yes The Intel Wifi Link 1000 and 6300 do NOT work.\u00a0 The NIC is an Intel 82579LM works well.The NVidia GPU works well with the nvidia driver.  eSATA port works fine, but you'll have to use cfgadm to \"reconfigure\" the device so it picks up the plugged in disk. Josef \"Jeff\" Sipek Lenovo ThinkPad T520 (4240-5NG) yes No support for Realtek RTL8188CE 802.11b/g/n WiFi Adapter. No support for Integrated Intel VGA (generic VGA driver is used - 1024x768 only). Marcel Telka Lenovo ThinkPad T578 yes The Intel Corporation Centrino Wireless-N 1000 does NOT work. As noted for T520 it is not supported by Illumos. Logan Bruns Lenovo ThinkPad W520 yes Nvidia Quadro 1000m and Intel Centrino Ultimate-N 6300 (3x3 AGN). Cameron Jones Lenovo ThinkPad X220 yes Graphics Intel HD 3000 (Sandy Bridge) suffers from bug 8049 on the laptop's primary display if intel Xorg driver is used (vesa is fine but the display then has non-native 1024x768 resolution), but VGA (D-Sub) to external display works correctly. Intel 82579LM Ethernet controller works with e1000g driver. Wifi Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205 is attached to iwn driver but I did not test it so far (I don't see any wi-fi networks). Audio Intel HDA from C200 chipset works with audiohd driver. Touchpad, trackpoint, keyboard and USB mouse work. Volume &amp; other buttons don't work. Michal Nowak Multirama-HT Xpress Book yes Apostolos Syropoulos Panasonic Toughbook Cf-18 yes Works, with VESA graphics driver. No Wacom driver for Xorg. Audio works through headphone output, no internal speaker. Disable system bell to avoid freezes. No 56k modem. ACPI works for battery status, no brightness adjustment. Networking and Wifi work. Bryan Lotti Sony VAIO VGN-S3XP yes cardbus does not work. nvidia driver does not fully support NV6200 Go chipset. System76 Bonobo Extreme yes Nripendra Khan System76 Galago UltraPro yes \u00a0Driver: VESA Ankita Davis Toshiba Satellite L855 (PSKACE) no AMD Radeon HD 7670M Graphics requires KMS driver, which we don't have, so VESA only. Unfortunatelly display's native resolution is 1366x768 but the this resolution is not one of VESA modes, so 1024x768 or 800x600 has to be used, which renders the screen blurry. Nor HDMI nor VGA (D-Sub) works.Integrated Ethernet controller Atheros AR8161 is not supported, nor is Atheros AR9485 mini-PCI WLAN.What works: ACPI, battery statistics, chipset in general (Intel C216), sound (Intel HDA), SATA disks in AHCI mode, VT-x (tested in illumos KVM), touchpad, USB (both EHCI &amp; xHCI) for input devices and storage.

Requires new firmware all around or the installation of an SSD triggers a bug that starts a thermal shutdown iLO works as expected. Download drivers directly from HP along with the scripting toolkit to make bios configuration changes in OS \u2013 neat level of integration Expect monthly firmware updates on this platform. HP has a fix it in the field approach. There has been some conflict between LSI cards and HPs passive midplane. Every other column of disks must be left vacant or data corruption occurs. Last December LSI and HP were pointing fingers at each other, however, this problem may be resolved. I am no longer in a position where i can risk the data on the disks to find out. I installed both midplanes and half the drive slots are empty at the moment. Jason Matthews HP ML110 G7 \u00a0yes Intel Xeon E3 1220, no reported driver issues.

Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E31220 @ 3.10GHz Socket 1 Ethernet 1 Intel 82574L Ethernet Controller Jorge Palma Escobar Intel MFSYS25  (6x blade server  chassis with  shared storage presented as SAN) yes No particular Solaris-related problems (all networking and storage components recognized by OI and several older Solaris 10 distros). Did not test MPxIO with Solaris because this box had no secondary IO controller (had it working with Linux and Windows on other such boxes). However the stability of remote serial console, remote graphical jKVM and remote media used for installation leaves a lot better to be desired (in comparison with Sun Fire IPMI/ILOM interfaces). May be a pain to install over pure remote-console networking, but this regards any OS we tried with the server. Physical distro media is\u00a0very much recommended. After that, all works well =) Jim Klimov Intel SR2625URLX yes No problems Intel S5520 motherboard Intel Corporation 82801JI (ICH10 Family) Intel Corporation 82575EB Gigabit Network Connection RMM3 works as expected (as an OEMd service processor from AMI), but no bmc driver support in OI (works in Solaris 11) Onboard SATA/SAS ports work in AHCI mode on the passive midplane but hot plug seems broken. I recommend internal LSI cards in any case. I did not try the serial console, but I would assume that works Hardware throws ECC errors on large memory installations (96GB) up until version 50 of firmware. Recommend v60+ System is unable to fast boot and generates an error about a 32bit address. Alter boot config in the repo to do a full boot to work around this problem.

It contains the Golden Copy of all the files and folders held in Git version control. Nobody can make changes to this repository, unless the project allows it. Fork Before contributing to a project using Git, you first need to make a server side copy of the upstream repository. When you do this, you are Forking the upstream repository. This copy of the repository is under your control. When you submit changes, they are stored in this copy of the upstream repository. Clone Before editing any files, you first need to Clone your forked copy of the upstream repository. Cloning creates a local working copy of the files and folders which resides on your computer. When you make changes, you are making changes to your cloned copy of the files and folders. You may locally clone the repository on as many computers as you wish."},{"location":"contrib/git/#git-vocabulary-commands","title":"Git Vocabulary - Commands","text":"<p>Now let's review some of the most commonly used Git commands and how you might use them.</p> Command Description <code>git clone</code> In the previous section, we already mentioned a little about clones and what they are.

Or alternately, when presented with the Live Media installer options menu, select the ChainLoad diskN option.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>After you have installed OpenIndiana, if you have another operating system installed, you might need to update the loader configuration. Usually you can achieve the desired effect by chainloading partitions with other operating systems. To configure the illumos loader to show an additional entry for chainloading another loader, create a file in /boot/conf.d directory, containing the string <code>chain_disk=\"disk0:\"</code>, where disk0 is the name of disk or partition to boot from. You can get the list of available disks from loader prompt using <code>lsdev</code> command.</p> <p>If you use GRUB2, you can configure it to show an entry for chainloading the illumos loader. Add the following to a file in the /etc/grub.d directory (usually the placeholder '40_custom' file can be used) of the Linux installation:</p> <pre><code>menuentry \"Chainload OpenIndiana\" {\n    set root=(hd0,2)\n    chainloader +1\n}\n</code></pre> <p>where hd0,2 is the location of the partition or disk containing the illumos loader. You can list detected disks/partitions from the GRUB prompt using the <code>ls</code> command. From Linux you can run <code>sudo fdisk -l</code> to list disks and partitions. The partition 'sda2' would map to 'hd0,2' in GRUB. After making changes you must run <code>sudo update-grub</code>, this updates the auto-generated GRUB configuration stored in /boot/grub/grub.cfg.</p>"},{"location":"handbook/getting-started/#install-openindiana-using-the-text-installer","title":"Install OpenIndiana using the Text Installer","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>The text based guided install starts and runs within a command line console.

Hence, unlike a .rpm file, an SVR4 package, or a .nbm file, it was not possible to transfer IPS packages from system to system. The remote IPS repository where the IPS package resided was the only source for the package. This is because in its native state, the IPS package is not something you can normally download as a single archive file.</p> <p>Recognizing this limitation of IPS, the <code>.p5p</code> IPS archive format was developed.

You can maintain multiple boot environments on your system, and each boot environment could have different software versions installed. Upon the initial installation of OpenIndiana onto your system, a boot environment is created. Use the <code>beadm</code><sup>1M</sup> utility to administer additional boot environments on your system.</p> <p>The <code>beadm</code> utility is designed to work in concert with the ZFS file system and the IPS package manager.</p>"},{"location":"handbook/getting-started/#why-use-multiple-boot-environments","title":"Why use multiple boot environments?","text":"<p>With multiple boot environments, the process of updating software becomes a low risk operation because you can create backup boot environments before making any software updates to your system. If needed, you have the option of booting a backup boot environment.</p> <p>Here are some specific examples where having more than one OpenIndiana boot environment, and managing them with the <code>beadm</code> utility, is useful:</p> <ul> <li> <p>When you use the <code>pkg update</code> command to update all the packages in your active OpenIndiana boot environment, this process automatically creates a clone of that boot environment. The packages are updated in the clone rather than in the original boot environment. After successfully completing the updates, the new clone is activated. Then, the clone will become the new default boot environment on the next reboot. You can boot the original boot environment explicitly selecting it from loader menu. <code>beadm list</code> command can be used to see a list of all boot environments on the system, including the backup boot environment that still has its original, unchanged software. If you are not satisfied with the updates made to the environment, you can use the <code>beadm activate</code> command to specify that the backup will become the default boot environment on the next reboot.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you are modifying a boot environment, you can take a snapshot of that environment at any stage during modifications by using the <code>beadm create</code> command. A snapshot is a read-only image of a dataset or boot environment at a given point in time. You can create custom names for each snapshot that identify when or why the snapshot was created. For example, if you are doing monthly upgrades to your boot environment, you can capture snapshots for each monthly upgrade. You can use the <code>beadm list -s</code> command to view the available snapshots for a boot environment. A snapshot is not bootable. But, you can create a boot environment, based on that snapshot, by using the <code>-e</code> option for the <code>beadm create</code> command. Then you can use the <code>beadm activate</code> command to specify that this boot environment will become the default boot environment on the next reboot.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can maintain more than one boot environment on your system, and perform various upgrades on each of them as needed. For example, you can clone a boot environment by using the <code>beadm create</code> command. A clone is a bootable copy of a boot environment. Then, you can install, test, and update different software packages on the original boot environment and on its clone. Although only one boot environment can be active at a time, you can mount an inactive boot environment by using the <code>beadm mount</code> command. Then you can use the <code>pkg update</code> command with the <code>-R</code> option to update all the packages in that inactive, mounted environment. Or, use the <code>pkg install packagename</code> with the <code>-R</code> option to update specific packages on that environment.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>When <code>pkg</code> creates new boot environment, it determines its name using <code>auto-be-name</code> image property. When prefixed with \"time:\" string, the remaining part of property is interpreted as <code>strftime(3C)</code> argument. If <code>pkg</code> can't produce unique boot environment name based on auto-be-name image property, it uses the property as base to generate unique name, appending numerical suffix prefixed by \"-\" symbol. Note, that due to name generation rules, any numerical suffix, prefixed by \"-\", can be incremented to generate unique name, so given \"time:openindiana-%Y-%m-%d\" <code>auto-be-name image</code> property value (which is not recommended), <code>pkg</code> will produce boot environment names ending with current date, current date + 1 and so on. By default <code>auto-be-name</code> is set to \"time:openindiana-%Y:%m:%d\", so that boot environments are named like \"openindiana-2019:03:29\".

Use ipfstat(1M) to display the statistics.</li> <li>skip number - skips the filter over number filtering rules</li> <li>auth - user program is requested to perform packet authentification in order to decide if the packet should be passed or not</li> </ul> <p>Following the action, the next word is in or out. This determines in which direction rules are applied, e.g incoming or outgoing packets.</p> <p>The option keyword is next. One can choose from:</p> <ul> <li>log - logs the packet is the packet matched the rule. Use ipmon(1M) to view the log.</li> <li>quick - rule with quick keyword is executed if packet matches it. No further rules checking is done.</li> <li>on interface - rule is applied only on interface in both directions</li> <li>dup-to interface - packet is copied and sent out on interface to specified IP address</li> <li>to interface - packet is moved to an outbound queue on interface</li> </ul> <p>Next are the keywords that determine if the packet matches the rule. The following keywords shown here can be used:</p> <ul> <li>tos - packet is filtered based on the type-of-service value written as decimal or hexadecimal integer.</li> <li>ttl- packet is matched based on its time-to-live value.</li> <li>proto - used to match a specific protocol. Any protocol name from /etc/protocols or its decimal representation can be used.</li> <li>from/to/all/any - matches either source or destination IP address of the packet and the port number. All accepts packet from any source to any destination.</li> <li>with - matches specified attributes associated with the packet. Inserted not/no in front of the keyword matches the packet only if the option is not present.</li> <li>flags - filters based on TCP flags that are set.</li> <li>icmp-type - filters based on ICMP type.</li> <li>keep keep-options - determines whetever state should be kept for a packet. state stores information about the session and can be kept on TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets. The frags keeps information about packet fragments and apllies them to later fragments. This option allows matching packets to pass without further ruleset evalution.</li> <li>head number - creates new group for filtering rules denoted by number.</li> <li>group number - adds the rule to group number.

It is not always feasible for one user to perform all administrative tasks. It would be more flexible if some tasks could be performed by some, say, experienced users. To enable some users to carry out a command with root privileges, or to do an administrative command <code>sudo(1m)</code> can be used. <code>sudo</code> can be configured to provide a user with elevated privileges for all commands requiring heightened privileges or configured to make only a select number of commands available to a user.

The administration of services is carried out on OpenIndian using Service Management Facility, commonly known as SMF.</p> <p>As application become more complex, their demands on system resources and peripheral resource increase. Modern applications often require more resource to provide more services. Resources such as an internet connection, a web server running in the background, a databank up and running in an appropriate state or mode of operation are increasingly found to be the prerequisite of modern applications. Although the application may provide users with a single service, the application might require many processes before it can itself run.</p> <p>To provide some system functionality, more than one process is required and some of these processes might depend on other processes. A modern application that provides some functionality might require a group of interrelated processes. We would like to start, stop, analyse, diagnose, in other words, manage the group as a single unit. We refer to such a unit as a service and the mechanism of providing this on OpenIndiana as Service Management Facility.</p> <p>SMF was originally developed to improve limitations of the old startup mechanism of the Solaris operating system using scripts known as <code>init.d</code>.</p> Service Management Framework on OI Purpose smf(7) Service Management Facility <p>A service is a definition of how a service should be started while a service instance is a precise configuration. Some services can have multiple instances whereas others are defined to be a singleton.</p> <p>Each service instance can be identified by a FMRI which uniquely defines each instance, which is why the SMF commands use FMRIs to identify services. A SMF FMRI is composed of three sections, the sections are delimited by a colon:</p> <pre><code>    service resource:service name:service instance\n</code></pre> <p>FMRIs are found in various areas: software packages, ZFS, etc., and the first part denotes this area or scheme. For software packages the scheme is  <code>pkg:</code>, while for services the scheme is <code>svc</code>.</p> <p>Many commands use the FMRI to identify service instances, but it is not the only way of specifying a service instance to the commands. In this manual, nomenclature is simplified as <code>[service]</code> as a unique identification of a service.</p> <ul> <li>Opensolaris documentation</li> </ul>"},{"location":"handbook/systems-administration/#smf-basic-commands","title":"SMF Basic Commands","text":"Command Purpose svcs(1) display information about services svcadm(7) manage services (enable/disable, ...) svccfg(8) configure services svcprop(1) display service configuration properties inetadm(8) initialise service managed by <code>inetd</code> inetconv(8) convert <code>inetd</code> service to smf services <p>Use of the SMF commands require relevant privileges.

Each zone is managed as a completely separate OpenIndiana machine. Zones have very low overhead and are one of the most efficient forms of OS virtualization.</p> <p>The global zone (GZ) is the operating system itself, which has hardware access. From the global zone, non-global zones (NGZ) are created and booted. Boot time for non-global zones is very fast, often a few seconds. The CPU, network, and memory resources for each zone can be controlled from the global zone, ensuring fair access to system resources. Disk space access is usually controlled by ZFS (with quotas and reservations if needed), as well as mounting of filesystem resources with NFS or lofs. As with other forms of virtualization, each zone is isolated from the other zones \u2013 zones cannot see processes or resources used in other zones. The low marginal cost of a zone allows large systems have tens or even hundreds of zones without significant overhead. The theoretical limit to the number of zones on a single platform is 8,192.</p> <p>Different releases of (Open)Solaris used different packaging distribution method for the global zone. OpenIndiana zones use two basic brands - \"ipkg\" and \"nlipkg\", which are based on IPS Packaging. The brand determines how zone is initialized and how zone's processes are treated by kernel. Both type of zones represent a PKG image. \"ipkg\"-branded zones are tightly coupled with GZ. Image pakaging system (IPS) knows about ipkg-branded zones and can perform several actions simultaneously in GZ and NGZ. For example, you can update all your zones and GZ with a single \"pkg update -r\" command. IPS can ensure some depenencies between packages in GZ and NGZ. To allow this it cheks that NGZ's publishers are a superset of GZ's publishers and their properties are the same (for example, stickiness or repository location). As this is not always suitable for development zones, \"nlipkg\"-branded zones were introduced. \"nlipkg\"-branded zone behave like completely independent instance and IPS ignores them during operations in GZ.</p> <p>An easy way to implement zones is to use a separate ZFS file system as the zone root's backing store. File systems are easy to create in ZFS and zones can take advantage of the ZFS snapshot and clone features. Due to the strong isolation between zones, sharing a file system must be done with traditional file sharing methods (eg NFS).</p> <p>When each zone is created  it comes with a minimal set of packages, and from there you can add and use most packages and applications as required.</p>"},{"location":"handbook/systems-administration/#zone-networking-model","title":"Zone networking model","text":"<p>OpenIndiana zones can use one of two networking models: a shared IP stack and an exclusive IP stack. There are pros and cons to each of them.</p> <p>Low-level system networking components, such as the ipfilter firewall and the kernel IP routing tables attach to an \"IP stack\", and are thus either unique to a zone or shared by all zones with the one shared stack. There are also some other nuances, such as that the zones with the shared stack can communicate over IP directly, regardless of their subnetting and, to some extent, default firewall packet filtering (that has to be specially configured), while exclusive-IP zones with addresses in different subnets have to communicate over external routers and are subject to common firewall filtering.</p> <p>The global zone defines which physical networks and VLANs the NGZ has access to, and hands down the predefined networking interfaces (the NGZ can not use or create other interfaces). Also, while shared networking allows to configure and attach (or detach) network interfaces from GZ to the NGZ \"on the fly\", changes in exclusive networking require reboot of the zone to propagate device delegation.</p> <p>A zone with an exclusive IP stack can have all the benefits of dedicated hardware networking, including a firewall, access to promiscuous sniffing, routing, configuration of its own IP address (including use of DHCP and static network addressing), etc. This requires a fully dedicated NIC. Usually this is a VNICs - a virtual adapter with own MAC address, that operate as if the VNIC was plugged directly into local LAN in a particular (or default) VLAN. Note also that the local zones with an exclusive IP stack are not subject to the host's shared-stack firewall.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Note that if you create zone in VM, the hypervisor can require you to provide some information about its mac addresses. For example, if you configure bridged networking on VirtualBox running on OpenIndiana, you must set secondary-macs property of the VNIC, delegated to VM, to the set of mac addresses  of VNICs created inside VMs and enable promiscous mode on VirtualBox network adapter.</p>"},{"location":"handbook/systems-administration/#quick-setup-example","title":"Quick Setup Example","text":"<p>Zone creation consists of two steps - creating zone configuration and zone installation or cloning. Zone configuration determines basic parameters, such as zone's root location and provided resources. Zone configuration is performed using zonecfg tool, zone administration (for example, installation) is performed using zoneadm tool.</p> <p>For example, we create a simple zone with shared networking model:</p> <pre><code># zonecfg -z example\nexample: No such zone configured\nUse 'create' to begin configuring a new zone.\nzonecfg:example&gt; create\nzonecfg:example&gt; add net\nzonecfg:example:net&gt; set physical=e1000g0\nzonecfg:example:net&gt; set address=192.168.0.10/24\nzonecfg:example:net&gt; end\nzonecfg:example&gt; set zonepath=/zones/example\nzonecfg:example&gt; verify\nzonecfg:example&gt; commit\nzonecfg:example&gt; exit\n</code></pre> <p>Here <code>create</code> puts you inside the zone configuration program where you can change and update settings particular to the zone specified with -z. <code>zonecfg</code> break different resource groups of data, you add a new resource with add. The next block adds ressource \"net\", configuring network in default <code>shared</code> ip-type mode. It allows zone to share IP stack with GZ. If you want to get dedicated nic in NGZ, you have to use <code>set ip-type=exclusive</code>. In exclusive mode zone has complete control over network interface and you can't assigned address in zonecfg prompt. After network configuration <code>zonepath</code> is set. It's a location for zone's root file system, which should be a ZFS filesystem. The <code>verify</code> command checks that no mistakes were made. Finally changes are committed (saved to zone configuration file).</p> <p>If you want to use dedicated networking for your zone, you should create VNIC and delegate it to the zone.</p> <pre><code># dladm create-vnic -l e1000g0 vnic0\n</code></pre> <p>If you want to specify VLAN id for VNIC, use <code>-v</code> <code>dladm create-vnic</code> option:</p> <pre><code># dladm create-vnic -l e1000g0 -v 123 vnic0\n</code></pre> <p>Now you can create your zone and delegate VNIC to it (note that we set zone's <code>ip-type</code> to <code>exclusive</code>):</p> <pre><code># zonecfg -z example\nexample: No such zone configured\nUse 'create' to begin configuring a new zone.\nzonecfg:example&gt; create\nzonecfg:example&gt; set ip-type=exclusive\nzonecfg:example&gt; add net\nzonecfg:example:net&gt; set physical=vnic0\nzonecfg:example:net&gt; end\nzonecfg:example&gt; set zonepath=/zones/example\nzonecfg:example&gt; verify\nzonecfg:example&gt; commit\nzonecfg:example&gt; exit\n</code></pre> <p>After configuring a zone you can install it with <code>zoneadm install</code> subcommand:</p> <pre><code># zoneadm -z example install\n</code></pre> <p>During installation pkg image rooted at $zonepath/root is created and minimal set of packages is installed to the image. When installation finishes, zone can be booted with <code>zoneadm -z example boot</code> command. If you want your zone to boot automatically during system startup, you should set autoboot parameter to true during zone configuration:</p> <pre><code>zonecfg:example&gt; set autoboot=true\n</code></pre> <p>Once zone is booted you can log in locally with <code>zlogin example</code>. If you created zone with dedicated network adapter, you should configure it inside zone.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Note, that on first zone boot sysding(1M) will set root's password to NP.

As with most Unix-like operating systems it can be completely controlled via a Command Line Interface shell, but it also supports a windowing GUI system.</p> <p>From the CLI, it supports a number of different shells, the two main ones being ksh93 and Bash. It also supports the original SunOS SVR4 commands, Like the command and syntax familiar to BSD users, and a large portion of the GNU userland commands that most Linux users are familiar with. You can select any or all of those different commands from your shell configuration, giving you the environment you are most happy with.</p> <p>By default, the windowing GUI system is based on the popular Mate system.</p> <p>OpenIndiana also has a powerful package manager, IPS, for updating and installing new software. Although powerful, it may seem complicated at first; but, help is provided in these pages.</p> <p>OpenIndiana supports a wide range of popular software, including the main open source Internet server software, databases, Internet client software, development languages and tools and more.

We've updated Xorg server and libraries, which allowed us to incorporate some important security fixes from Oracle x-s12-clone and Debian Xorg. Also we've moved much more closely to Gnome 2.32. Most packages were updated to this level, excluding packages which either have a lot of specific patches (like gdm) or just dropped some significant functionality (like cheese, which dropped HAL support in version 2.32). Not everything has gone smoothly. We had to drop trusted desktop support during update. I believe nobody seriously used it under OI. The most annoying thing is that updated Xorg and Intel driver require some DRM updates, which are still not ready.

OI now fully supports USB 3.0 devices. Intel Video drivers were significantly improved by Gordon Ross. The list of supported hardware has significantly extended.</p> <p>Xorg was updated to 1.18.4 version, so if you use any third-party modules \u2013 they might need recompilation or update (notably, the VirtualBox Guest Additions).</p> <p>Mate was updated to 1.16 version. We started shipping GTK3 applications. Several Gnome 2 applications, which don't have Mate analogs, were updated to Gnome 3 versions. A lot of end user applications are delivered now as 64-bit only.</p> <p>Installer no longer creates the classic auto_home layout, as it was a source of confusion to the users. Default home filesystem is created under rpool/export/home now. Old-school users or those with more complicated setups are free to set up the legacy configuration in their systems, the functionality is still there.</p> <p>We thoroughly tested IPS and imported several upstream fixes. Now IPS uses Apache 2.4 as its internal web server.</p> <p>GNU TLS 3.4 is the default TLS implementation now. We also introduced ca-certificates service to regenerate the CA bundle.</p> <p>Notice: on some resource-constrained systems <code>ca-certificates</code> service can fail to start immediately after system install. Later SMF takes care and restarts it, but you can see error messages on first boot. The issue is being investigated.</p> <p>Notice: if you upgrade from earlier versions, you can see errors about failing metainit service. It was removed from the system, but SMF fails to notice it. Just remove the service manually for now in this case:</p> <pre><code># svcadm disable -s svc:/system/metainit ; svccfg delete svc:/system/metainit\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"release-notes/2017.04-release-notes/#desktop-software-and-libraries","title":"Desktop software and libraries","text":"<ul> <li>Xorg was updated to 1.18.4, xorg libraries and drivers were updated.</li> <li>Mate was updated to 1.16</li> <li>Intel video driver was updated, the list of supported hardware has significantly extended</li> <li>libsmb was updated to 4.4.6</li> <li>gvfs was updated to 1.26.0</li> <li>gtk3 was updated to 3.18.9</li> <li>Nimbus theme was updated to look better with GTK3, so we started shipping GTK3 applications</li> <li>Rhythmbox was updated to 3.4.1</li> <li>Major text editors were updated (we ship vim 8.0.104, joe 4.4, emacs 25.2, nano 2.7.5</li> <li>pulseaudio was updated to 10.0</li> <li>firefox was updated to 45.9.0</li> <li>thunderbird was updated to 45.8.0</li> <li>critical issue in enlightenment was fixed, now it's operational again</li> <li>privoxy was updated to 3.0.26</li> <li>cdrtools were updated to 3.02a7</li> <li>gthumb was updated to 3.2.9.1</li> <li>brasero was updated to 3.12.1</li> <li>critical issue in sound-juicer was fixed, now it's operational again</li> <li>Gstreamer 1.10.3 and gstreamer 1.0 plugins were integrated</li> <li>WebkitGTK2 was updated to 2.14.5</li> <li>Mesa was updated to 13.0.6</li> <li>Nvidia driver was updated to 340.102</li> </ul>"},{"location":"release-notes/2017.04-release-notes/#development-tools-and-libraries","title":"Development tools and libraries","text":"<ul> <li>GCC 6 was added.
