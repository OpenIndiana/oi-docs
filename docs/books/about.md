!!! note
    When using these books, please bear in mind:

    * The OpenIndiana Project has republished these books primarily for their reference value.
    * Although vast portions of these books are still relevant, significant divergence has occurred between OpenIndiana Hipster and OpenSolaris/Solaris Express.
    * Some of the books in this collection reference publications which were either never open-sourced by Sun Microsystems or never released by the OpenSolaris Project.
        * For example, the _OpenSolaris Developer's Reference Guide_ was never released as part of this collection.
      However, the illumos project has published a similar title: [The illumos Developer's Guide](https://illumos.org/books/dev/)
    * There are lots of broken links to OpenSolaris.org and Sun Microsystems.
    * In some cases, it may be possible to follow broken links by using the [Internet Archive Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/).
