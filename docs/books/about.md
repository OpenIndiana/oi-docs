# About OpenSolaris Redistributable Books

Consisting of 41 titles and originally published on July 15th, 2009, this collection represents the final docs release of the OpenSolaris project.
For ease of use, the titles have been organized by subject matter and grouped according to their intended target audience.
For each title, a brief synopsis has been provided.
Otherwise, the books are exactly as originally published.
No editing of any kind has been performed on any of the titles.
This documentation collection has been released under the [Public Documentation License (PDL)](../misc/pdl.md).

!!! note
    When using these books, please bear in mind:
    
    * The OpenIndiana Project has republished these books primarily for their reference value.
    * Although vast portions of these books are still relevant, significant divergence has occurred between OpenIndiana Hipster and OpenSolaris/Solaris Express.
    * Some of the books in this collection reference publications which were either never open-sourced by Sun Microsystems or never released by the OpenSolaris Project.
        * For example, the _OpenSolaris Developer's Reference Guide_ was never released as part of this collection.
      However, the illumos project has published a similar title: [The illumos Developer's Guide](https://illumos.org/books/dev/)
    * There are lots of broken links to OpenSolaris.org and Sun Microsystems.
    * In some cases, it may be possible to follow broken links by using the [Internet Archive Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/).
