| Relevancy to OpenIndiana Hipster | **OBSOLETE; although portions may still be valid**.</p>**Deprecation notes:** Subsequent to the release of OpenSolaris 2009.06, the Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) was selected as the default print service, however, the lp print service was retained. This change was implemented in preparation for the OpenSolaris 2010.03 release.</p>The proposed release notes for OpenSolaris 2010.03 included this statement: "CUPS support includes a web and graphical interface to manage your printing environment. A system that is running CUPS becomes a host that can accept print requests from client systems, process those requests, and then send them to the appropriate printer. To facilitate CUPS support, a new print-service command has been introduced that provides a mechanism for switching between CUPS print service and the LP print service, including 2 new SMF services."</p>**Doc Team Notes:** Oracle Solaris dropped support for lp when they introduced CUPS in the Solaris 11.0 release. The OpenIndiana project retained both print subsystems, which are managed by the `print-service` command. Both `lp` and `lpr` are symbolically linked to `print-service`. Issuing the command `print-service -q` shows the active print subsystem, which by default is CUPS. More information can be found in the print-service (1M) man page.
