## Hipster as a NAS

OpenIndiana provides several ways to share data with network clients.

| Implementation | Description
| --- | ---
| CIFS | Kernel based SMB file sharing solution offering ZFS integration, ease of use, and relatively simple configuration.
| SAMBA | Modern userland based SMB file sharing solution providing support for newer SMB protocols (SMB 2.1) and better compatibility with modern Windows clients.
| NFS | The Network File System was originally developed by Sun Microsystems.

ITEMS TO WRITE ABOUT:

For a variation of configuring a home NAS - this could be done virtually as well

* Running OI as a VMware EXSI guest
    * Local storage hardware is passed through to the OI guest and then shared via ISCSI, CIFS, NFS, etc.

### Hipster as a CIFS server (workgroup)

< Placeholder for introduction content >


#### Commands used

* `sharemgr` - configure and manage file sharing
* `smbadm` - configure and manage CIFS local groups and users, and manage domain membership
* `zfs` - configures ZFS file systems
* `passwd` - change login password and password attributes
* `chown` - change file ownership


#### Configuration steps

Start by listing available storage pools.

`zfs list`

```bash
NAME                           USED  AVAIL  REFER  MOUNTPOINT
storage                        498K   899G    19K  /storage
```

Create your ZFS dataset to be shared via CIFS/SMB.

```bash
zfs create -o casesensitivity=mixed -o sharesmb=on storage/backup
```

Start the CIFS service.

```bash
svcadm enable -r smb/server
```

Join the CIFS server to a workgroup.

```bash
smbadm join -w WORKGROUP
```

Configure PAM authentication for the CIFS service.

```bash
echo "other password required pam_smb_passwd.so.1 nowarn" >> /etc/pam.conf
```

Reset the password for the local user accounts which will be used for remotely accessing the CIFS/SMB share.

```bash
passwd <user_account>
```

Set the share name to be used for the CIFS/SMB share.

```bash
zfs set sharesmb=name=backup storage/backup
```

Change the ownership of ZFS dataset to the user account which will be used for remotely accessing the CIFS/SMB share.

```bash
chown -R <user_account> /storage/backup
```

Verify everything is all set to go.

`sharemgr show -vp`

```bash
default nfs=()
smb smb=()
        * /var/smb/cvol  smb=() ""
                  c$=/var/smb/cvol       smb=(abe="false" guestok="false")      "Default Share"
zfs smb=()
    zfs/storage/backup smb=()
          backup=/storage/backup
```

You can create additional CIFS datasets using the following 4 commands.

* `zfs create -o casesensitivity=mixed -o sharesmb=on <pool_name/dataset_name>`
* `zfs set sharesmb=name=<new_share_name> <pool_name/dataset_name>`
* `chown -R <user_account> <path_to_dataset>`
* `sharemgr show -vp`

#### Adding a remote share using the Linux smbclient

* [Accessing an SMB Share With Linux Machines](http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/SMB-HOWTO-8.html)


#### Adding a remote share using the KDE Dolphin file manager GUI

* In the left hand pane click _Network_
* In the right hand pane click _Add Network Folder_
* The Network Folder Wizard opens
* Select the radio button for _Microsoft Windows network drive_ and click next
* Specify a name for the share - can be anything - this is just a label
* Specify the remote CIFS/SMB server name (or IP address)
* Specify the share name of the remote CIFS/SMB share
* Click the save and connect button
* You'll be prompted for a remote username and password
* Ensure the checkbox is marked to save credentials or you'll be asked for everything you do.
