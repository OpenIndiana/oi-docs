    * Used to find keywords in man pages
* find - search for files in a directory hierarchy
* info - read Info documents
    * A viewer for GNU info pages
* locate - find files by name
    * Uses the mlocate database to find files and folders
* man - an interface to the on-line reference manuals (man pages)
    * To pipe the output of a man page to a text file use the command: `man [manpage] | col -x -b > [filename].txt`.
    * For example: `man pkg | col -x -b > pkg.txt`

## Developing with OpenIndiana

<i class="fa fa-info-circle fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **DOC TEAM NOTE:**
<div class="well">
The book titled "Introduction to Operating Systems: A Hands-On Approach Using the OpenSolaris Project" may be a good resource for helping to complete this part of the handbook.

Questions to ask:

* How can OI be used as a development platform?
* What programming tools, languages, etc., are available?
* How can OI be used to further the development of OI itself?
</div>

## Software Development Testing

<i class="fa fa-info-circle fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **DOC TEAM NOTE:**
<div class="well">
Need to add some guidance about how to add a test repo to test specific packages, etc.
