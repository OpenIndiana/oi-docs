# Getting information about hardware

If your are running the standard MATE install of Openindiana, then Device Driver Utility (ddu), provided by `diagnostic/ddu` package, is your friend (it is located by default under Applications->System Tools).

When run, it will provide a list of hardware sorted by category and the driver (if used).

The device line can be copied into the relevant HCL table, along with which driver is being used.
If for any reason you don't want (or can't) enter it yourself into the HCL, feel free to email the details (Device, driver, OI hipster 'osnet-incorporation' and 'userland-incorporation' versions and status) to hcl-feedback@openindiana.org and the oi-dev mailing-list.
