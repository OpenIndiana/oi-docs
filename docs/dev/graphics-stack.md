# Graphics stack

Like most UNIX/Linux operating systems, OpenIndiana's GUI environment is based on
the X Window System bundled with libraries and applications developed by
the [freedesktop.org](https://www.freedesktop.org/) community.

Therefore the Graphic Stack is comprised of:
* the opensource X11 display server Xorg, client libraries and utilities developed by the [X.org Project](https://www.x.org/),
* an OpenGL implementation in the form of the opensource [Mesa](https://www.mesa3d.org/) library,
* and illumos kernel drivers for different graphics adapters provided by the [gfx-drm](https://github.com/illumos/gfx-drm) gate,
* together with the [libdrm](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/drm) implementing communication between kernel drivers and user-space components through the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI) protocol.

All these components can be installed using the unified build system [oi-userland](https://github.com/OpenIndiana/oi-userland) or simply installed from the package repositories.

Notes concerning different components are provided:

 Component             | Scope
 --------------------- | ----------------
   [Xorg](#Xorg)       | Building the Xorg display server, protocol headers, client libraries and applications.
   [Mesa](#Mesa)       | Building the Mesa library and testing OpenGL capabilities.
   [Fonts](#Fonts)     | Packaging new fonts for OpenIndiana.
   [Nvidia](#Nvidia)   | Installation of Nvidia's proprietary graphics driver for Solaris.
   [gfx-drm](#gfx-drm) | Building the illumos KMS drivers and libdrm from the gfx-drm gate.

## Xorg

All the Xorg components are build in oi-userland and located in the x11 directory:

<https://github.com/OpenIndiana/oi-userland/tree/oi/hipster/components/x11>

A bogus component is provided to rebuild the X11 gate:
<https://github.com/OpenIndiana/oi-userland/tree/oi/hipster/components/x11/x11-gate>

The upstream Solaris code is located at:

<https://github.com/oracle/solaris-userland/tree/master/components/x11>

## Mesa

To build Mesa use the [x11/mesa](https://github.com/OpenIndiana/oi-userland/tree/oi/hipster/components/x11/mesa) component.

## Fonts

Font components in oi-userland are located in the [components/fonts](https://github.com/OpenIndiana/oi-userland/tree/oi/hipster/components/fonts) directory.

## Nvidia

Nvidia provides Solaris x86-64/x86 packages of their proprietary driver for different families of graphic adapters.

The Nvidia driver shipped with OpenIndiana is built using [openindiana/nvidia](https://github.com/OpenIndiana/oi-userland/tree/oi/hipster/components/openindiana/nvidia) component.

The list of currently supported and legacy drivers is updated on the [Unix Drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html) page.

304.xx   | Legacy GPU                   | GeForce 6 to GeForce 600 series  | Driver 304.137

The drivers series 340.xx is currently part of oi-userland, others may be installed manually following Nvidia's instructions.

Note on new driver installations:

```
# beadm create oi-nvidia
# beadm mount oi-nvidia /mnt
# pkg -R /mnt uninstall x11/server/xorg/driver/xorg-video driver/graphics/nvidia
# /bin/sh NVIDIA-Solaris-x86-390.48.run --extract-only
# cd NVIDIA-Solaris-x86-390.48
# pkgadd -R /mnt -d . NVDAgraphics NVDAgraphicsr
# bootadm update-archive -R /mnt
# beadm unmount -f oi-nvidia
# beadm activate oi-nvidia
# init 6
```

## gfx-drm

The gfx-drm gate consists of different kernel components for support of various graphic adapters in the illumos and the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI) library, libdrm.

Component  | Description
---------  | ------------
libdrm     | The library enables communication between kernel components and user-space libraries through the DRI protocol.
agpart     | Kernel driver for the Graphics Address Remapping Table (GART) / Graphics Translation Table (GTT) support.
header-drm | System headers for DRM/KMS kernel drivers and user-space libraries.
i915       | Intel KMS driver for Intel Graphics Media Accelerator (GMA) and Intel HD Graphics adapters.

### Intel KMS driver

The xorg-video-intel package is the open-source 2D graphics driver for the X Window System as implemented by X.org. It supports a variety of Intel graphics chipsets including:

* i810/i810e/i810-dc100,i815,
* i830M,845G,852GM,855GM,865G,
* 915G/GM,945G/GM/GME,946GZ
* G/GM/GME/Q965,
* G/Q33,G/Q35,G41,G/Q43,G/GM/Q45
* PineView-M (Atom N400 series)
* PineView-D (Atom D400/D500 series)
* Intel(R) HD Graphics,
* Intel(R) Iris(TM) Graphics,
* Intel(R) Iris(TM) Pro Graphics.

Open source kernel driver(s) by Oracle:

<https://github.com/oracle/solaris-userland/tree/master/components/x11/kernel/sun-src>

The relevant kernel code is located in drm and i915 subfolders.

An illumos port of Oracle code is available here:

<https://github.com/illumos/gfx-drm>

Martin Bochnig, creator of OpenSXCE, initially backported the S12 driver to illumos available in oi-userland until December 20, 2016.

It was then superseeded by the new gate providing improvements to the gfx_private interface and agpgart driver, as well as containing userland libraries used by graphics, like libdrm.

#### Known Issues

##### SNA

SNA may cause segmentation faults if enabled. If so, just disable SNA and you can copy the attached 20-intel-uxa.conf to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/.

For now UXA mode is set by default.

#### Sandy Bridge GT1

A hardware bug required implementing a workaround in the Intel ringbuffer implementation, occasional 1-2 second hangs may occur.

#### Gen >= 8

Generation 8 (and later) devices are not supported at all.
They require Intel ringbuffer support, which is not implemented.
