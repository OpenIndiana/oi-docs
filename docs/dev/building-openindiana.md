## Build process

The OpenIndiana Hipster build process is rather simple.

Once a pull request has been merged to [oi-userland](https://github.com/OpenIndiana/oi-userland) [Jenkins](https://hipster.openindiana.org/jenkins/) starts an incremental oi-userland build.
For components coming from other source repositories manual intervention can be necessary to start the build.
[illumos-gate](https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate) is rebuilt daily in a separate [Jenkins job](https://hipster.openindiana.org/jenkins/job/illumos-gate/).

If packages are built successfully they are either published to the [main Openindiana package repository](http://pkg.openindiana.org/hipster/) or to the [package repository for patent-encumbered software](http://pkg.openindiana.org/hipster-encumbered/).

Note that the main OpenIndiana package repository also contains packages inherited from the now discontinued OpenIndiana /dev distribution.
Such packages are available only in binary form and can be identified by a `2013.0.0.0` branch number.

Twice per year the OpenIndiana developers create ISO images based on this repository using the [Distribution Constructor](./distribution-constructor.md).

If you want to build a customized ISO image you can publish necessary additional packages to your own repository and use [Distribution Constructor](./distribution-constructor.md) to create images with additional publishers and/or packages.
