How to verify:

* Download `<ISO>.sha256sum.asc` file from mirror
* Run: `gpg2 --verify <ISO>.sha256sum.asc`. You should see the following output:

```
    gpg: Signature made Tue May  2 14:29:55 2017 CEST
    gpg:                using RSA key 0x3A021AFADBE31887
    gpg: Good signature from "OpenIndiana Release Engineering" [unknown]
    gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
    gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
    Primary key fingerprint: F5E9 84E5 ADD2 9578 D45C  C1FE 3A02 1AFA DBE3 1887
```

  Even if the output includes:

```
    gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
    gpg: There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
```

  The signature is still correct.
* Run: `digest -a sha256 <ISO>` and check the ISO checksum as previously.

## General system changes

The most notable change for this snapshot is related to hardware support.
OI now fully supports USB 3.0 devices.
Intel Video drivers were significantly improved by Gordon Ross.
The list of supported hardware has significantly extended.

Xorg was updated to 1.18.4 version, so if you use any third-party modules – they might need recompilation or update (notably, the VirtualBox Guest Additions).

Mate was updated to 1.16 version. We started shipping GTK3 applications.
Several Gnome 2 applications, which don't have Mate analogs, were updated to Gnome 3 versions.
A lot of end user applications are delivered now as 64-bit only.

Installer no longer creates the classic auto_home layout, as it was a source of confusion to the users.
Default home filesystem is created under rpool/export/home now. Old-school users or those with more complicated setups are free to set up the legacy configuration in their systems, the functionality is still there.

We thoroughly tested IPS and imported several upstream fixes.
Now IPS uses Apache 2.4 as its internal web server.

GNU TLS 3.4 is the default TLS implementation now.
We also introduced ca-certificates service to regenerate the CA bundle.

Notice: on some resource-constrained systems `ca-certificates` service can fail to start immediately after system install.
Later SMF takes care and restarts it, but you can see error messages on first boot.
The issue is being investigated.

Notice: if you upgrade from earlier versions, you can see errors about failing metainit service.
It was removed from the system, but SMF fails to notice it.
Just remove the service manually for now in this case:

```
# svcadm disable -s svc:/system/metainit ; svccfg delete svc:/system/metainit
```
