-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

How to verify:

* Download `<ISO>.sig` file from mirror
* Run: `gpg2 --verify <ISO>.sig <ISO>`. You should see the following output:

```
    gpg: Signature made November  5, 2019 at 05:40:09 PM UTC
    gpg:                using RSA key F5E984E5ADD29578D45CC1FE3A021AFADBE31887
    gpg: Good signature from "OpenIndiana Release Engineering" [ultimate]
```

  Even if the output includes:

```
    gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
    gpg: There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
```

  The signature is still correct.

## General system changes

All OpenIndiana system software was rewritten in Python 3.
Installation images now don't deliver Python 2.7 interpreters or libraries, however some software still requires Python 2.7.
We've moved to GCC 7 as the default compiler.

## Desktop software and libraries

* LibreOffice 6.4.3 was added. There are some issues with GTK 3 theme, so "gen" VCL plugin is used by default. You can experiment with GTK3 plugin, setting SAL_USE_VCLPLUGIN environment variable to gtk3 explicitly.

* Mate Power Manager policy was adjusted to avoid suspending computer unless specifically overwritten by the user due to issues with wakeup on modern hardware.
