Note, it is just old repackaged perl 5.10.0 from /dev compiled with Sun Studio, only manifest was patched to deliver mediated links. Perl 5.10 is still used while compiling illumos-gate.</li><li>If you just update old library/perl-5/database and other modules you'll receive new packages, which are just meta-packages, new packages will likely pull library/perl-5/\*-516 packages and you'll stay without old modules, so remember to install corresponding library/perl-5/\*-5100 packages after update (if someone is interested 5100 stands for perl 5.10.0). </li></ul>
