-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

How to verify:

* Download `<ISO>.sig` file from mirror
* Run: `gpg2 --verify <ISO>.sig <ISO>`. You should see the following output:

```
    gpg: Signature made October 23, 2018 at 03:15:31 PM UTC using RSA key ID DBE31887
    gpg: Good signature from "OpenIndiana Release Engineering" [unknown]
    Primary key fingerprint: F5E9 84E5 ADD2 9578 D45C  C1FE 3A02 1AFA DBE3 1887
```

  Even if the output includes:

```
    gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
    gpg: There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
```

  The signature is still correct.

## General system changes

During this development cycle we've worked on fixing VirtualBox, updating Firefox and Mate.

Other noticeable changes include moving of some OI-specific applications from Python 2.7/GTK 2 to Python 3.5/GTK 3,
merging updates from OmniOS CE IPS (including automatically named boot environments), rebuilding and fixing issues in
libiconv conversion modules.

## Late news (known issues)

Firefox can fail to spawn child processes on the first launch. After being restarted it runs fine.

In some scenarios Firefox hangs or crashes.
In many cases enlarging the swap helps.
In the example below we enlarge swap from 4 to 8 GB:

```
$ zfs get volsize rpool/swap
NAME        PROPERTY  VALUE  SOURCE
rpool/swap  volsize   4G     local
$ pfexec zfs set volsize=8g rpool/swap
$ pfexec reboot
```
