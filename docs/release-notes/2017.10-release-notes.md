-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

How to verify:

* Download `<ISO>.sig` file from mirror
* Run: `gpg2 --verify <ISO>.sig <ISO>`. You should see the following output:

```
    gpg: Signature made Tue 31 Oct 2017 11:19:40 AM MSK using RSA key ID DBE31887
    gpg: Good signature from "OpenIndiana Release Engineering" [unknown]
    Primary key fingerprint: F5E9 84E5 ADD2 9578 D45C  C1FE 3A02 1AFA DBE3 1887
```

  Even if the output includes:

```
    gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
    gpg: There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
```

  The signature is still correct.

## General system changes

Xorg was updated to 1.19.5 (Note, that if you run OI as VirtualBox guest, you should switch to vesa driver, as latest VirtualBox guest additions (currently 5.1.30 or 5.2.0) don't provide Solaris xorg drivers for Xorg 1.19). An issue causing Xorg being launched as root was fixed.

Mate was updated to 1.18 version.

IIIM (Internet/Intranet Input Method Framework) is not delivered by default on GUI image (IBus is shipped instead) and will be removed soon. Installer was reworked to configure XKB for switching keyboard layouts in Mate (when it is installed). US layout is always the default one. Additional layout is selected based on chosen language.

Text installer now can perform basic OpenIndiana installation to existing ZFS pool (for example, in parallel to existing OpenIndiana installation). The option is considered advanced and should be used with care, but allows you to install minimal OI system to existing pool. To use it, press F5 on 'Welcome' screen.

Cluster suite was updated.

We've worked with MongoDB developers to fix several issues in MongoDB 3.4 component. The possibility of running MongoDB OI buildbot is being investigated.

We've started to remove Gnome 2 applications and libraries. Be warned if (by some strange reason) you still haven't switched to Mate.

ABI compatibility for Solaris 10u10 binaries was added.
