-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

How to verify:

* Download `<ISO>.sig` file from mirror
* Run: `gpg2 --verify <ISO>.sig <ISO>`. You should see the following output:

```
    gpg: Signature made October 23, 2018 at 03:15:31 PM UTC using RSA key ID DBE31887
    gpg: Good signature from "OpenIndiana Release Engineering" [unknown]
    Primary key fingerprint: F5E9 84E5 ADD2 9578 D45C  C1FE 3A02 1AFA DBE3 1887
```

  Even if the output includes:

```
    gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
    gpg: There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
```

  The signature is still correct.


## General system changes

Work on delivering 64-bit-only applications continues: another batch of 50 components was migrated to 64-bit while most newly added software defaults to 64-bit.

Note, that although ISO and USB images support booting in UEFI mode, it's still work in progress.
VGA console is not supported when system is booted in UEFI mode and installer still misses some steps to create bootable UEFI images.

Python 3.5 is now delivered and numerous Python modules were updated.
Image Packaging System was fixed to work with updated modules.
A lot of fixes from OmniOS CE IPS and Oracle IPS were integrated to OI IPS.

Due to recent security fixes compatibilty with some Solaris applications was broken.
Most noticeable one is VirtualBox.

GCC 8 was added alongside GCC 6 and GCC 7: these compiler packages include modifications for building illumos.

## Late news (known issues)

It was found that due to bug in vmnat new OpenSSH client behind VMware NAT fails to communicate with outside servers (connection terminates with broken pipe after authentication). Recommended workaround is to add "IPQoS throughput" to your /etc/ssh/ssh_config.
