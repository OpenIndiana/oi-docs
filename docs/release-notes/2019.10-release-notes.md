How to verify:

* Download `<ISO>.sig` file from mirror
* Run: `gpg2 --verify <ISO>.sig <ISO>`. You should see the following output:

```
    gpg: Signature made November  5, 2019 at 05:40:09 PM UTC
    gpg:                using RSA key F5E984E5ADD29578D45CC1FE3A021AFADBE31887
    gpg: Good signature from "OpenIndiana Release Engineering" [ultimate]
```

  Even if the output includes:

```
    gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
    gpg: There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
```

  The signature is still correct.

## General system changes

During this development cycle we've worked on updating IPS, migrating remaining OpenIndiana-specific applications to Python 3, rewriting some DDU closed binary blobs.

## Desktop software and libraries

* VirtualBox was updated to 6.0.14
* Xorg fonts, tools and libraries were updated.
* FreeType was updated to 2.10.1
* GTK 3 was updated to 3.24.12
* LightDM was updated to 1.30
* mpg123, x265, and mpack packages were added, x264 was updated
* Powerline, the nice status line, was added and integrated with Bash, tmux, and Vim
* Supplementary x11-init service was added to create necessary directories with root permissions prior to X11 applications startup

## Common tools and libraries

* IPS was synced to the latest OmniOS CE version. Now it ships only Python 3.5 tools and libraries.
    - to build oi-userland after removing Python 2 pkg module you need to update the userland [build environment too](https://github.com/OpenIndiana/oi-userland/commit/fb10babbcfd65ff74cf439bc77a2186fd79ee2a7);
    - to build gfx-drm you need latest `developer/build/onbld package`;
    - to build illumos-gate you have to add `export BUILDPY2TOOLS="#"` to your illumos.sh.
* DDU binaries, for which we missed sources, were rewritten, DDU was converted to Python 3.5
* Bash was updated
* top and htop now both report ARC and compressed ARC statistics
* Vim was updated to 8.1.1721, Nano was updated to 4.5
* Sudo was updated to 1.8.29

## Development tools and libraries

* GCC compilers were updated to 7.4.0, 8.3.0, GCC 9.2 was added (note, GCC 6.5 is still the default oi-userland compiler)
* Clang 8.0 was added. Clang 4.0 was removed.
* Git was updated to 2.23.0.
* CMake was updated to 3.15.1.
* Rust was updated to 1.32.0.
* Python modules were updated.
* Golang 1.13 was added

## Server software

* MongoDB 4.0 was updated.
* Nginx was updated to 1.16.1.
* Samba was updated to 4.11.
* Node.js was updated to 12.13.0, 10.17.0, and 8.16.2
* BIND was updated to 9.14
* OpenLDAP was updated to 2.4.48
* tor was updated to 0.4.1.6

A lot of other bug fixes and minor software updates are included.

## illumos

As always, we are proud to ship the latest illumos-gate bits ([87d7b64](https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate/commit/87d7b64204c06f7d85b6dfec442ff0aba82efe9a)).

Some of the more interesting changes include:

* illumos is now build with GCC 7 by default. GCC 4.4 is kept as a shadow compiler and for SPARC (not delivered by the OpenIndiana project)
* `PAGER` variable is no longer being set. It used to be set to `/usr/bin/less -ins`, which caused problems for some users. `man(1)` still does paging via `/usr/bin/less -ins` when `PAGER` is not set.
* `cxgbe` firmware and Intel microcode were updated
* Various improvements and fixes were ported from the ZFS on Linux project:
    - native data and metadata encryption
    - sorted scans
    - zpool ashift property is now tunable
    - support UNMAP/TRIM for SSD (disabled by default)
    - Log Spacemap
* Old DRM and AGP code was removed, the [GFX DRM gate](https://github.com/illumos/gfx-drm/) is the sole source of DRM code.
* Security:
    - The L1TF mitigation (CVE-2018-3646) was integrated.
    - Multi-architectural data sampling mitigations (various CVEs) were implemented.
    - Hyper-threading can be disabled.
    - Kernel is built with retpolines.
* A lot of SMB 3 features were merged:
    - continuously available shares,
    - persistent handles
    - signing, encryption
    - ACLs
    - named pipes
    - extended attributes
    - file level locking
* A lot of old SPARC code (deprecated platforms and device drivers) was removed.
* `zoneadm list`'s `-n` option lists non-global zones only.
* `netstat` got the `-u` option to list PIDs associated with sockets
* NVMe improvements (e.g. drive firmware updates).
* mandoc was updated to 1.14.5.
* Code of Conduct was adopted.
* Rust got MDB symbol demangling support.
* XHCI polled mode is supported for USB keyboards.
* `nawk` was updated to NAWK upstream circa 2018 code.
* The `NULL` macro is casted to type `void *` (a requirement POSIX.1-2008).
* The C.UTF-8 locale is provided.
* Added `reallocf(3C)` function.
* FreeBSD's pluggable congestion control framework was ported, enabling [CUBIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUBIC_TCP) and [NewReno](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6582) algorithms, which have higher performance than "sunreno" in some circumstances.
* The default algorithm for new passwords is SHA512
* crontab(1) now supports "/step", e.g.: `*/2 * * * * echo "run every two minutes"`
* UEFI boot improvements: `bootadm install-bootloader` (or `installboot` if run directly) now populates/maintains the ESP.
* Bug in our keyboard driver, which prevented SPICE display mechanism of the Linux KVM to work properly, was fixed.

## Other activities

A lot of work was done to update documentation from [outdated wiki](https://wiki.openindiana.org) and move it to new [docs site](https://docs.openindiana.org) and [oi-userland docs](https://github.com/OpenIndiana/oi-userland/tree/oi/hipster/doc).
