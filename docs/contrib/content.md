# OpenIndiana Content Creation

<i class="fa fa-info-circle fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **NOTE:**

## Why Fresh Website Content is so Important

Good docs and a steady stream of fresh website content inspires confidence in the project.
These things show the project is alive and thriving.
Here are a couple of end user quotes which serve as a reminder.


### A User Comment Posted to the OI Wiki in 2011

>Documentation such as a manual is essential in not just learning from, it tells everyone where the product is in the scheme of things.
>Referring to Oracle for documentation relating to OI just makes one have less confidence with OI itself.
>Look at the FreeBSD site documentation levels are really good and gives people confidence to try FreeBSD and its derivatives.

### A User Comment Posted to the FreeBSD Forum in 2013

>FreeBSD has been around almost as long as Unix itself existed (not entirely true, but you get the idea) and same can be said for Solaris as it was.
>Yet the OpenSolaris group basically still has to prove themselves.
>For all I know (from a commercial point of view) they could be gone next month.
>That makes it a liability, especially in comparison to Sun being out of the picture and the love/hate relationship with Oracle.

The goal of this page is to inspire you to contribute to the OpenIndiana Project by assisting with content creation.
