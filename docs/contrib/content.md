# OpenIndiana Content Creation

<div class="note" markdown="1">
!!! note
    ## Why Fresh Website Content is so Important
    
    Good docs and a steady stream of fresh website content inspires confidence in the project.
    These things show the project is alive and thriving.
    Here are a couple of end user quotes which serve as a reminder.
    
    
    ### A User Comment Posted to the OI Wiki in 2011
    
    >Documentation such as a manual is essential in not just learning from, it tells everyone where the product is in the scheme of things.
    >Referring to Oracle for documentation relating to OI just makes one have less confidence with OI itself.
    >Look at the FreeBSD site documentation levels are really good and gives people confidence to try FreeBSD and its derivatives.
    
    ### A User Comment Posted to the FreeBSD Forum in 2013
    
    >FreeBSD has been around almost as long as Unix itself existed (not entirely true, but you get the idea) and same can be said for Solaris as it was.
    >Yet the OpenSolaris group basically still has to prove themselves.
    >For all I know (from a commercial point of view) they could be gone next month.
    >That makes it a liability, especially in comparison to Sun being out of the picture and the love/hate relationship with Oracle.
