# Documentation Team Roles


There are multiple ways community members can contribute to the OpenIndiana Documentation revitalization effort.
These contributions fall into several different roles.
Each role requires a different skill level.

## Prerequisite skills

Basic familiarity with:

* Text editors
* The Asciidoc text markup syntax (in particular the Asciidoctor version of it)
* GIT distributed version control
* The Awestruct framework

Most pages are written in Asciidoc text markup.
The skill level required to work with these pages is minimal.
Other pages (indexes, layouts, etc.) are composed in HAML.
Modifying HAML pages requires basic front end web development skills.

## Content Creator

The easiest way to help the docs revitalization effort is by writing content.
The content creator would (as the title suggests) develop content to be hosted on the docs website.
Content could include just about anything, news posts, tutorials, Howto's, or larger efforts such as the handbook or updating the OSOL books.

The nice thing about helping with content creation is the level of commitment is entirely up to the individual.
In other words, there is no requirement to get involved in anything major.
In contrast, it would probably be better to start small and only later consider taking on something larger.
Helpful skills would include a willingness to write and work as a team with content reviewers.

As needed, the content writer consults with community members performing other roles.

## Content Reviewer

The content reviewer would effectively perform the roles of editorial reviewer, configuration manager, release manager, and as needed, coaching others in their roles.
This person would review pull request and provide editorial feedback to content creators.
This role would also engage with the website developer to help place content appropriately as well as assist the website developer with site organization.
As needed the content reviewer may also perform the role of quality assurance, by running the site in development mode to changes to HAML pages, menus, etc.
Helpful skills would include good organization, people skills, as well as a knack for performing editorial reviews.


## Website Developer

The docs website developer would work with content creators and content reviewers helping to improve and extend site functionality and organization.
This role requires front end web development skills and would be working directly with the Awestruct framework and its components.
The website developer would also be working with Awestruct extensions, helpers, and  may also include working directly with the Awestruct API.
Helpful skills would include experience with Ruby, HAML, HTML, CSS, Compass, SASS, etc.
