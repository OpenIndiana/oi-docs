## Style recommendations

* Document titles - First letter of each word capitalized.
* Sectional titles - First letter of first word capitalized.
* One (1) space between sectional titles and beginning of text.
* Two spaces after last line of text and beginning of next sectional title.
* One sentence per line (the only exception to this is where you need multiple sentences to fit into a single table cell).
