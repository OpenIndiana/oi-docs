# OpenIndiana Code of Conduct

This document provides community guidelines for a safe, respectful, productive, and collaborative place for any person who is willing to contribute to the OpenIndiana community.
It applies to all "collaborative space", which is defined as community communications channels (such as mailing lists, IRC, submitted patches, commit comments, etc.).


## Core principles and expectations:

* We are respectful and appreciative towards peoples work, time, and effort.
* We are tolerant of the right to have opposing views.
* We recognize our public actions determine the public perception of the project.
* Participants must ensure their language and actions are free from personal attacks and disparaging personal remarks.
* When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always assume good intentions.
* Always seek to maintain a welcoming environment for new contributors.
    * Welcome new people to the project and guide them in their contributions.
    * Give them the time you were given when you first joined the community.
    * And if you weren't given enough time please set a new example for others to live by.
* Be open and transparent so others can participate on an equal footing and contribute to the project in their own way.
    * Everyone has something to contribute.


## What will not be tolerated:

* Discrimination based on gender, race, nationality, sexuality, religion, age or physical disability.
* Open hostility, and or abusive language.
* Repeated complaining (rehashing) of closed (decided) issues.
* Participants who disrupt the collaborative space, or participate in a pattern of behavior which could be considered harassment.
* Filibustering - (replying with negative or opposing viewpoints to every post in a mailing list thread).


## Reporting violations:

* Violations of the CoC should be reported to the distribution maintainers via <conduct@openindiana.org>.
    * Neither reporters nor reported persons will, or should be, made public.
* Upon receipt of a problem report, the distribution maintainers will investigate the issue and determine whether it warrants further action.
    * Any further action will be proportional to the severity of the problem.
